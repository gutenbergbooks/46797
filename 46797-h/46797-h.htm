<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>:—It is with great pleasure
that I have responded to my publisher’s appeal
for a new volume in connection with boy pioneer
life during those early days in the history of
our country when brave men, and women also,
kept pushing the frontier line constantly westward,
toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>Since Bob and Sandy Armstrong came to the
end of their migrations when they settled on
the land purchased by old David, near the
junction of the Missouri River with the mighty
Mississippi, it is obvious that little that is new
could be written concerning those old friends
of ours.</p>

<p>But as it happened that they founded families
of their own, and each had a son who was
said to be a “chip of the old block,” the story
of young pioneer achievements can best be continued
by transferring our allegiance to these
two sturdy lads, Dick and Roger, whom, I feel
sure, you will like fully as well as you did their
fathers.</p>

<p>Just at the time when they had become strapping
lads, ready to place full confidence in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
ability to take care of themselves, it chanced
that a wonderful opportunity came to them,
whereby they were enabled to traverse the
course of the great Missouri River from its
mouth to its far-away source among the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<p>What this opportunity was like, and what astonishing
things they met with on the long and
dangerous journey, I have endeavored to describe
and set down between the covers of this
present book. I trust that you will enjoy reading
it fully as well as you did the preceding
volumes; and that at some date in the near
future we may meet again in the pages of still
another story of boy pioneer life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>TWO BOYS IN A DUGOUT CANOE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">We</span> are on the worse side of the river,
Cousin Roger, if a storm breaks!”</p>

<p>“That is true, Dick; but it may not come
down on us for hours yet; and the fish are
taking hold finely now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no one likes to pull them in better
than I do; but it seems to me we already have
enough in the dugout to supply the whole Armstrong
settlement.”</p>

<p>“Then mother can send some down to the
Cragans in the St. Louis settlement; for they
are old, and Mr. Cragan seldom goes out on the
Missouri nowadays. Just wait a little longer,
Dick. Oh! what a tug that was! Why, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
keep getting bigger all the while. Look, the
finest buffalo fish we’ve taken this afternoon,
Dick! Did you ever see such a savage fighter?
It makes my arms ache to drag him in against
this current.”</p>

<p>“Mine have been feeling sore for a long
time, now; but, when you get fishing, Roger,
you never do know when to stop. Well, I’ll
give in again, and stay a little longer, though
I think we are taking big chances with that
storm. But you must put a limit on the fish to
be taken. When we have three more, no matter
whether they are large or small, we’ll wind up
our lines and cross the river.”</p>

<p>“Make it five, Dick, please; that’s only a
little thing when the fish are biting as they are
now.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Roger; but not another
one, no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I always keep my word, even if they
do call me Headstrong Roger, just as my father,
Sandy Armstrong, was before me. Five it
shall be, Dick; and see! that can take only a
little while; because I’ve hooked one before
my line was more than half-way out. And see
him fight, will you? This is the best fishing
we’ve had this year. It makes me think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
great times our fathers used to have, away up
on the Ohio, where they built their first log
cabin, before Grandfather Armstrong emigrated
to the new Mississippi country.”</p>

<p>For several minutes talkative Roger had to
devote all his attention to pulling in the large
captive that struggled at the end of his line;
and, as his cousin also felt a savage tug about
the same time, both were busily engaged.</p>

<p>We may take advantage of their occupation
for a brief time to explain just who were the
two lads, thus engaged upon the rolling current
of the great Missouri River, far back in the
summer of the year 1804, when English speaking
people were few and far between in this
new region, but recently acquired by the United
States. (<a id="Note_1r"></a><a href="#Note_1">Note 1</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Years before the grandparents of these lads
had left Virginia at the solicitation of the great
hunter and backwoodsman, Daniel Boone, who
had discovered the richness of the Kentucky
country, and was trying to induce settlers to
occupy it, despite the savage Indians who resisted
their advance.</p>

<p>They had settled on the Ohio, and, with other
hardy souls, started to develop homes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wilderness; and here the two sons of David
Armstrong, Bob and Sandy, met with many
strange adventures that have been narrated in
the first volume of this series.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Later on, a terrible flood, such as the Ohio
valley had never before known at that early
day, when its banks were lined with primeval
forests, had swept the cabins of many of the
settlers away, and so discouraged them that a
party decided to build a floating house on a raft,
and go further down the river, looking for new
homesteads in the wilderness, this time in the
valley of the mighty Mississippi.</p>

<p>This houseboat had managed to run the
gauntlet of all sorts of perils from hostile
Shawanees and jealous French trappers, who
resented the invasion of what they believed to
be their territory by the daring English settlers.</p>

<p>In the end the mighty Mississippi had been
reached, and at first the Armstrongs had tried
to establish their new home below the junction
of the two rivers. It was, however, just before
the breaking out of the Revolutionary War,
when, over the entire country, settlers were
taking sides, either in favor of the colonists or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the king; and, as fortune would have it, the
sentiment in the little community around the
Armstrongs seemed to be so saturated with
what they called “loyalty” to the far-distant
sovereign that by degrees things became utterly
unbearable to old David and his stalwart
sons.</p>

<p>Conditions had altered so much that in these
dark days the French, who had all along been
looked upon as enemies, now became warm
friends of the colonists. This came about not
so much through change of sentiment on the
part of the French as a desire to strike back at
King George by lending assistance to his rebellious
colonies; but, whatever might be the
reason, the Armstrongs were content to accept
the new order of things, and make the best of
them.</p>

<p>Accordingly old David went away prospecting,
and later on returned with wonderful accounts
of the splendid opening that awaited
those who would settle down close to the new
and enterprising border trading post, which
had been named St. Louis in honor of the
French king.</p>

<p>In the end they had once more “pulled up
stakes,” though it was not so hard to do so this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
time, as they had not become greatly attached
to the home on the shore of the Mississippi, or
their intensely patriotic neighbors, who delighted
to annoy them because they favored the
cause of Washington and his “rebels,” as the
Continental army was called at that time.</p>

<p>In their new location near St. Louis the Armstrongs
had labored hard to make a permanent
home. As the years slipped past, the boys had
grown to young manhood; and presently the
older brother, Bob, married the daughter of
another settler on an adjoining farm, one
Nancy Adams.</p>

<p>In due time a second cabin was constructed,
to which Bob took his young wife; and just a
year later Sandy followed his example, marrying
the young school teacher, Phoebe Shay, and
also erecting a home of his own; so that there
was now quite a little settlement of the Armstrongs,
with old David as the head of the
family.</p>

<p>As the months and years passed children
came who called David grandfather; Bob had
two boys named Dick and Sam; while Sandy
rejoiced in the possession of a sturdy lad,
Roger, and a sweet girl who was named Mary,
after her Grandmother Armstrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>When David obtained the tract of land upon
which he settled, and which was just outside
the limits of St. Louis, he believed that he had
done all that was necessary to secure his title
to the same. And, as he watched the adjoining
settlement augment in size as the years passed
on, Mr. Armstrong congratulated himself on
having laid a foundation for his family that
would bear much valuable fruit in course of
time.</p>

<p>The King of France had given this whole
tract to certain Frenchmen in consideration of
services which they had rendered the Crown;
and in turn they had passed portions over to
new arrivals as the result of bargains that
were struck between them.</p>

<p>But, as frequently happens, there was always
a possibility that, in times to come, a
missing link might be discovered in the title,
calculated to bring about trouble for the possessors.</p>

<p>Here amidst these pleasant surroundings the
children of the Armstrong brothers grew up,
and began to take their places in the little community
of which they were destined to form
important units.</p>

<p>As the boys grew older they naturally took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the same things that had been of such prime
importance in the lives of their fathers. Hunting
and fishing were of the utmost necessity to
these early pioneers, since only by such means
were they enabled to provide for many of the
family wants. Indeed, but for the bounty of
Nature in supplying such vast quantities of
game, the task of settling the waste places of
our country would have been a much more difficult
one than was the case.</p>

<p>Of course, as their two sons grew tall and
more manly, Bob and Sandy Armstrong went
less and less into the forest, and out upon the
waters, contenting themselves with an occasional
hunt in the season of laying in “pemmican,”
as the dried venison and buffalo meat
of the Indians was called, for the winter’s
store. They had plenty to do in developing
their farms, for the work in those days was
much more exacting than in recent years, when
so many labor-saving farm implements are
used.</p>

<p>Those who have read the earlier volumes in
this series of pioneer books can easily understand
that if the two lads, Dick and Roger,
resembled their fathers as much as people said,
they were a pair of resolute young fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
when, at about the age of fifteen, we make their
acquaintance.</p>

<p>Dick was steady-going, though he could be
as quick as a flash should the necessity require.
He was more apt to deliberate, and do the right
thing, than his younger cousin, Roger, who had
inherited his father’s, Sandy Armstrong’s, impetuous
nature, and was inclined to be a little
reckless.</p>

<p>Both were good-hearted, manly boys, and
blessings to their parents. They had early in
life learned many of the secrets of woodcraft
as known to those hardy, early pioneers, and
could read the signs of the trail as well as most
old trappers, accustomed to spending their
lives in the wilderness, where danger lurked
back of every falling leaf, with hostile Indians,
and revengeful French trappers, hovering
around.</p>

<p>The English were numerous at the St. Louis
settlement, and had, moreover, taken such good
measures to fortify the post that no successful
foray was ever engineered by the allied tribes
of the West looking to its reduction. And as
a certain wampum belt, presented to the Armstrong
boys by the great sachem, Pontiac, for
valuable services which they had rendered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
him,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> still seemed to possess a potent power
over the Sacs, Pottawatomies, Foxes, and other
tribes of Indians, the little settlement above
St. Louis, on the Missouri, had never once been
molested by the redskins, though other places
had been attacked from year to year.</p>

<p>It was at this time, with spring only lately
passed, that we find the cousins out upon the
Missouri, enjoying their favorite occupation,
and having such great sport that Roger could
hardly be convinced that they should give up
the fishing if they hoped to cross the wide
river, and reach home, before the threatening
storm broke.</p>

<p>It had promised rain nearly all day, which
had been a rather hot, muggy one; but, as it
seemed to be the finest fishing day they had enjoyed
all season, both boys had taken chances
in coming out. There were times when the
stock of provisions ran rather low at home,
since the crops were only getting their early
summer growth, and fresh fish would always
be acceptable among the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>Roger had so much trouble with his latest
capture that Dick brought his to the boat before
his cousin could. Perhaps this was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
he went about his task with deliberation;
while the other lad, in his eagerness, allowed
the heavy fish to drag the line out several
times, on account of not being prepared for his
sudden rushes.</p>

<p>This fact is only mentioned in a casual way
to let the reader understand thus early in the
story what the different natures of our two
heroes were; for doubtless there will occur
many instances when these leading characteristics
must stand out most prominently.</p>

<p>“That makes two of the five, Dick!” gasped
Roger, as he managed to unhook his capture,
and, after once more baiting his stout hook,
cast it far out into the rolling stream for a
fresh trial.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other, who had already
allowed his own line to run out to its full
limit; “and, if they keep on taking hold as
they have been doing, we’ll soon have the other
three in the dugout. But you never can tell
with fish. They stop biting all of a sudden,
and nothing you can do will tempt them to start
in again.”</p>

<p>“There comes another big one, Dick! Oh!
isn’t it too mean, he just gave a terrible plunge,
and broke away. That’s bad luck, I’m afraid,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
exclaimed the younger of the fishers, in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>“And I suppose he was the biggest of the
whole lot?” the other remarked with a laugh.</p>

<p>“There, something’s at my bait again!”
ejaculated Roger, eagerly. “Don’t I hope he
swallows it, hook and all!”</p>

<p>He braced himself for the tug, having
learned what tremendous pullers these so-called
buffalo fish of the rivers could be, when
they had the whole force of the current back of
their efforts. A few seconds later his line gave
a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I’ve got my second one, and that
makes three!” he whooped gleefully, as he
started to pull in hand over hand, for they were
not fishing with poles, and such things as reels
were unknown among the early settlers of the
West.</p>

<p>Half way did Roger drag his expected prize
in, when he uttered a dismal cry.</p>

<p>“He’s gone, Dick, worse luck!” he exclaimed
in a disappointed tone. “Perhaps
there’s something wrong with the barb of my
hook, they seem to get off so easy of late; I’d
better be looking after it. Anyhow, the bait
must be gone, and I never yet caught a fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with a bare hook. Hope you have better luck
with yours,” as Dick started pulling his line
in, with something that wriggled tremendously
at the other end.</p>

<p>“All of which,” remarked the other boy,
with a smile, “goes to show that, as Grandfather
Armstrong says, it’s poor policy to
count your chickens before they’re hatched;
and a fish on the hook isn’t always a fish in the
boat. Look what I’ve caught!”</p>

<p>“An eel, and a big one at that!” exclaimed
Roger, looking up from examining the point of
his hook, which he found to be in excellent condition
after all, so that the fault, if any there
was, did not lie there, but possibly in his manner
of giving the wriggling fish too much slack
line. “Better knock him on the head before
you take him in, because a slippery customer
like that will soon own the whole boat, and
drive us over the side, if he gets to whipping
around.”</p>

<p>This was good advice, as Dick well knew, and,
picking up a billet of wood which they used to
dispatch their fish in a humane way when
caught, he finally succeeded in killing the large
fresh-water eel.</p>

<p>But, somehow, that seemed to put an end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the fishing, for, although they tried the most
tempting bait, they did not get another nibble.
Even the big yellow catfish, for which the Missouri
has always been famous, some of them
running up to sixty pounds, declined to bite.</p>

<p>Dick grew anxious at the delay, and several
times hinted to his cousin that it would be the
part of wisdom for them to give up, even
though they still lacked three fish. But it was
a difficult task to drag Roger from anything he
had set out to do, and he kept reminding the
other that they had set a limit of five fish, and
that the fish were apt to take hold again at any
minute; he was sure he had felt a cautious
nibble at his bait just then, and, given another
chance, they could easily haul in three more, big
or little, it mattered not.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gust of wind came sweeping
across the river, and made the dugout rock violently.
Looking up, the boys saw that already
the breeze was whipping the surface of the Missouri
into whitecaps, as the squall rushed
across.</p>

<p>“We’ve waited too long, Roger, you see!”
declared Dick, calmly; “and now we’ve got to
find some sort of shelter from the storm, on
this side of the river!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE HOLLOW TREE REFUGE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">All</span> my fault, Dick!” said Roger, as they
hastened to pull in their lines, and then get the
rude anchor up, for their position was an exposed
one, with that furious wind sweeping all
the way from the other shore of the wide river.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything about it, Roger; what
we want to do now is to get to work, and use
the paddles. Quick! or we’ll be blown over,
with the side of our boat exposed to that rush
of wind!”</p>

<p>They worked with all their power to get the
rough dugout headed for the shore in time to
have the wind behind them, for they had been
fishing some distance from the wooded bank.
The boat had been fashioned from a selected
log by the boys themselves, and was as good a
specimen of its kind as any of the settlers
owned; but at the best such a craft is apt to
prove clumsy at a time when quick action is
required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>As a result the wind struck them before they
were quite prepared, and for a moment it
looked as though the frail craft would be capsized,
so violently was it tossed by the gusts, as
well as by the turbulent waters.</p>

<p>“Dip deep, Roger!” shouted Dick, compelled
to raise his voice on account of the roar
of the wind, which sounded as though a million
bumblebees had swarmed around their heads.</p>

<p>They bent themselves to the task, and put all
their energies into keeping the dugout from
upsetting. Perhaps the wind was merciful,
too, and relaxed its violence a trifle, but, be
that as it may, the two lads succeeded in accomplishing
the feat of turning the boat head
on toward the shore, and with only a few
strokes of the paddles they found themselves
driven violently against the high bank, against
which the waves were already breaking.</p>

<p>“Just below, there’s a little bight, where the
boat can hold out against it, if only we can get
her there!” Dick called aloud; for he had
noticed all these things while fishing, perhaps
with an eye to future use should necessity compel
them to seek a haven of refuge.</p>

<p>“Together, then, Dick, fend off, and let her
float down a little!” cried Roger, ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
jump overboard if necessary in order to save
the boat, together with the fine catch of fish,
from being turned over by the waves.</p>

<p>But the distance was very short, and so
sturdily did the two boys labor that in the end
they were able to push their craft around a
high point of rock that jutted out from the
shore, and find a haven just behind, in which
the boat might weather the storm in safety.</p>

<p>But, from the appearance of the darkened
sky across the river, it was evident that they
might expect a heavy downpour of rain shortly;
and, if they hoped to escape getting soaked,
they had better go ashore without delay, and
seek some sort of shelter.</p>

<p>“Will our fish be safe here, do you think?”
asked Roger, loth to leave their prizes unguarded
in the boat.</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess so; but come along, we can’t
stay here. Pick up your gun and let’s look for
a couple of hollow trees, or a fallen one that
will shelter us beneath its roots. Hurry, Roger,
it’ll soon be on us!”</p>

<p>They had quickly tied the painter of the dugout
canoe and, with one last anxious look at the
fish, Roger scrambled up the bank at the heels
of his cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The guns the boys carried were, of course,
the long-barreled rifles of the times, equipped
with a flint lock and powder-pan. Although
such weapons may excite more or less amusement
in these days of the repeating rifle, and
the hammerless shotgun, still those men of the
old border, with their steady hands and hawk-like
vision, were capable of doing marvelous
execution with them. And as boys learned how
to shoot before they were as tall as the guns
owned by their sires, it can be readily understood
that both the Armstrong lads were splendid
marksmen.</p>

<p>The woods along the banks of the Missouri
in those days were untouched by the axe of the
backwoodsman, and must have been a sight, indeed,
with many of the trees three or more feet
through the butt.</p>

<p>Here and there one of these forest monarchs
had been felled by some hurricane that had
swept through the region in years that were
past; and it was in the direction of these that
the boys cast eager glances in the hope of finding
a shelter from the downpour that threatened.</p>

<p>Right and left they glanced, missing nothing
with those keen eyes, now put to their best efforts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
since a necessity for a haven had arisen,
if they hoped to avoid being soaked to the skin.
And, as they both were dressed in tanned buckskin
garments, fashioned after the manner customary
with the hunters of that early day, with
fringe and colored porcupine quills adorning
both trousers and tunic, the task of drying their
clothes was one that would take more or less
time.</p>

<p>It seemed but a few minutes before a shout
from Roger announced a happy discovery.</p>

<p>“Oh! look, there’s the very place for us, if
we can climb the tree and crawl in at that opening,
Dick! On my word I believe that’s the
biggest hollow tree I ever ran across, and I’ve
seen a few. Shall we try it?”</p>

<p>Cautious Dick glanced once more around
him; but apparently could see no other opportunity
to get away from the threatening deluge.</p>

<p>“All right, then, we’ll have to chance it!”
he replied, as he started for the big tree.</p>

<p>Roger did not understand what these words
meant until they had come to the wide trunk of
the oak and he discovered many scratches
there, indicating that some wild animal must
have its sleeping quarters in the hollow above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“A bear’s den, Dick!” he ejaculated, looking
at his companion doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guessed as much,” answered the
other, “when I saw tracks over yonder. But
let’s hope the old fellow happens to be away
just now. I wouldn’t take the risk did not
those black clouds look so threatening.”</p>

<p>“Shall we climb up, then?” asked the other,
ready to accept any risk, in his headstrong
way.</p>

<p>“Yes, come on, Roger; but keep your gun
ready for business,” replied Dick.</p>

<p>It was always a matter of some concern to
the early pioneers, this keeping their rifles or
muskets in condition for immediate use. The
powder was apt to be shaken from the pan, or
the flint in the hammer dislodged just enough
to keep it from striking fairly, and sending out
the important spark, which was absolutely
necessary in order that the weapon be discharged.
And hence, under the most intense
excitement, hunters were wont to keep a watchful
eye upon their guns in order that they
might not fail.</p>

<p>Both boys scrambled up the tree. The limbs
were low, and fashioned just right for a quick
ascent, and, as the hole which had caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
eye of Roger was not more than twenty feet
from the ground, they were beside it in an exceedingly
short space of time.</p>

<p>But it might be noticed that neither seemed
in any great haste to enter the gaping aperture
that frowned so darkly before them. They
could easily tell that it was a bear’s den from
the odor that greeted them, such as may always
be detected where wild animals have their lodging;
but even stout-hearted Roger would have
braved the wrath of the coming deluge rather
than drop down upon a savage bear.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s in, right now, Dick?”
he questioned.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You see there was no time
to examine the tracks below, and see whether
the last ones headed in, or out. But we’ll soon
learn that. Fire your gun as straight down
into the stump as you can, Roger; while I keep
mine ready to give him a shot if he comes out.”</p>

<p>“A good idea, Dick; and here goes!”</p>

<p>Roger pushed his long rifle into the hole as
well as he could, and, aiming downward, pulled
the trigger. The roar that followed was terrific
in that confined space, and Roger hastily
dragged his gun out, preparing to reload. He
had in his early years been taught the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
principle among hunters, that an empty gun is
worse than none at all.</p>

<p>Dick was waiting, ready to send a bullet into
the head of Bruin, did he but make his appearance;
but, as nothing followed the report of his
cousin’s rifle, he bent forward to look once
more into the black aperture.</p>

<p>“Not at home, is he, Dick; or do you think
I could have been lucky enough to have killed
him by a chance shot?” demanded Roger,
hopefully.</p>

<p>“Oh! no danger of that,” replied the other,
laughingly. “It’s an empty den that we’ve
run across, and the sooner we crawl inside the
better.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Roger, “I felt a big splash of
rain on my face then. But how far down do
you think the hole goes, Dick? I hope not all
the way to the roots of the old tree. How could
we climb up again; and what a tumble it would
be if we let go and dropped.”</p>

<p>For answer Dick dropped a piece of heavy
bark into the opening, and bent his ear in an
endeavor to tell from the sound just about how
far it had to fall.</p>

<p>“I think it’s all right, Roger,” he said;
“but to make sure I’m going to tie to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
branch this piece of rope that I brought with
me, and lower it inside. Then we can always
have something to pull ourselves up with.”</p>

<p>“It takes you to think up such things,” was
the comment of the other boy, who greatly admired
his cousin’s thoughtfulness, though seldom
able to shine in that same respect himself.</p>

<p>Giving his gun in charge of Roger while he
worked, the older lad quickly tied one end of
his piece of rope to the limb alongside the
opening.</p>

<p>“Now we can climb in, and none too soon,
for there comes the rain with a whoop that
sounds like an Indian attack!” he remarked.</p>

<p>Dick would have gone first, but it would
never do for headstrong Roger to allow any
one to precede him, when there was an atom
of danger to face. So he swung in, and blocked
the passage of the other, though with a good-natured
laugh.</p>

<p>He had shifted his rifle to his back by means
of the strap that was attached to it for that
very purpose. This allowed him to have both
hands free. Having dropped down so that he
was hanging from the rim of the opening,
Roger failed to touch the bottom with his
dangling feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t seem to make it, Dick,” he called
out; “but now I’m going to try the rope.
Hurrah! here’s the bottom at last; and I
judge that it’s only about eight feet or so below
the opening. Coming down, now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, because here’s the rain pouring down;
keep out of the way, Roger,” with which remark
the older boy started down.</p>

<p>He found no difficulty in landing beside his
cousin. The big tree was hollow half-way
down to its roots, so that hardly more than a
mere shell of the outside remained.</p>

<p>“Listen to it come down, Dick!” exclaimed
the younger lad, presently. “Sounds as if the
clouds had broken above, and meant to put the
river up to the flood stage again, after it had
started to go down. And the wind blows pretty
hard, too. I hope, now, it doesn’t knock this
old oak over, and give us heaps of trouble.
Wasn’t that thunder I heard? What if lightning
should strike here? Perhaps we were
foolish to try so hard to escape a ducking, Dick.
There may be some things worse than a wet
jacket, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Roger, and I’m glad you look
at it that way; but we’re in here now, and perhaps
we’d better stay, and take our chances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Such a storm will soon be over; and, when the
wind goes down some, we can paddle across the
Missouri without running the risk of a bad
spill. We promised mother not to take too
many chances, because she dreads the water,
after losing her brother the way she did in the
drifting ice three years ago this spring.”</p>

<p>The wind howled dismally around them, and
the rain beat heavily against the thin shell of
the tree, so that at times it creaked and
groaned in a way that excited the fears of
Roger anew, for he thought it might be about
to give up its long fight, and yield to the
storm’s fury.</p>

<p>But Dick kept his courage up by words of
good cheer.</p>

<p>“Already I think the worst is over,” he returned.
“It seems to me the noise does not
come quite so heavily; and yes, when you look
up, Roger, you can even see light at the opening,
something that I couldn’t do before. We’ll
have to wait here a little while, and then we
can crawl out to hunt up our boat, and start for
the settlement on the other shore.”</p>

<p>Roger naturally twisted his neck in order to
see the glad sight of daylight above; but immediately
gave expression to a cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Dick, knowing from
the tone of his cousin’s exclamation that he had
seen something that meant new trouble for
them.</p>

<p>“The bear, Dick!” gasped the other boy.</p>

<p>“What about him?” demanded Dick; but
doubtless he was able to make a pretty good
guess concerning the nature of the discovery.</p>

<p>“He just stuck his snout into the hole as if
he smelled us; and look there, will you? All
the light is shut out! Dick, what shall we do?
For I believe the bear is starting to back down
inside the tree!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>A SHADOW OVER THE HOMESTEAD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no such thing as catching Dick
unprepared. No doubt he had before now considered
just what should be done in such an
emergency.</p>

<p>Even while the excited Roger was speaking,
Dick had acted. Of course the only thing that
could be done in order to give the descending
bear a fright was to fire a shot into his hindquarters
at close range. No bear could stand
that, Dick felt certain. The only thing that
gave the boy cause for concern was that the
animal might have pushed into the opening so
far that, in his alarm, he would lose his grip
above, and come down upon them, crushing
both under his weight.</p>

<p>The report of Dick’s rifle sounded like a peal
of thunder. There was a tremendous clawing
noise above, and, for a brief interval, Dick’s
heart was in his throat.</p>

<p>Then the clawing ceased inside the hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
tree, and, at the same time, Roger’s voice rang
out.</p>

<p>“He’s climbed out in a bigger hurry than he
came in, Dick! You gave him a pain that time.
He must think hornets have built a nest in his
old den, and you won’t get that smart bear coming
back here in a hurry again. There, I heard
him strike the ground! Perhaps you hit him
harder than you meant to, Dick, and we might
get him for the larder, if we wanted!”</p>

<p>“Not much chance of that when I had only
his hindquarters to shoot into,” the other declared;
“but, all the same, he’s skipped out,
and taken to the woods. What’s a little rain
to a furry coat like his, after sleeping all winter?
But one thing is sure, Roger, the rain is
slackening up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added the other, “and the wind,
too; for it doesn’t howl as it did. But, let me
tell you, I’m glad that thunder doesn’t growl
so much now. When that loud crash came I
got a bad scare, because I thought how lightning
likes to pick out a big oak like this, and
splinter it from top to bottom.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have known what hurt you,
if it had struck this tree; and there’s a little
satisfaction in that, Roger. But, when I get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
my gun loaded, I mean to climb up, and take
an observation.”</p>

<p>“How lucky that we’ve got that rope to help
out,” remarked Roger; “for the inside of this
old tree feels as smooth as anything, because
the bear has clawed his way up and down so
many times. We would have had a hard job
getting up, only for that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there are ways, if you only bother
thinking them out,” observed the other boy.
“With two of us down here, one could climb
on the shoulders of the other and, after he got
out, help his comrade with his hands. Oh!
you’re off, are you? I wondered if you would
wait, and let me go first for a change. But,
now that you’re half-way up, keep right on,
and tell me how things look to you. Be careful
how you poke your head out, because, after all,
the bear might be waiting for us.”</p>

<p>Roger had little difficulty in reaching the
opening. He was so nimble that he could climb
any tree like a monkey; but, remembering the
warning of his cousin, he tried to take an observation
before thrusting his head out.</p>

<p>“All clear, here, Dick!” he called, joyfully;
“you gave him a scare, let me tell you—chances
are he’s running yet. And better still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the clouds have broken across the river, for,
would you believe it, the sun’s peeping out!
Better come up, as the rain’s stopped now.”</p>

<p>That was good news for the boy in the hollow
tree, and he lost no time in following his
companion. Presently both were perched upon
the wet limbs, looking around.</p>

<p>“You wounded the bear, Dick, for, see, here
are blood marks on the bark,” cried Roger,
pointing as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Which I am sorry for,” was the reply,
“because I never like to hurt an animal unless
I want him for food. And we couldn’t think
of trying to follow the trail of the bear at this
late hour. Mother might be worried if we
didn’t come home by dark, after such a sudden
storm. So let’s head back to the boat, and, if
the waves have gone down enough, we’ll push
out for the other bank.”</p>

<p>“Whew! did you ever see such big bear
tracks, Dick?” exclaimed Roger, as he bent
down to examine the imprints. “The chances
are, now, we’ll never set eyes on anything to
beat that in all our lives again;” but, when the
boy made that statement, and believed what he
was saying, too, he could not possibly foresee
the time when he and his cousin would look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
upon the distant Rocky Mountains, just then
almost unknown to white men, and view that
greatest of all bears, the terrible grizzly of the
foothills. Yet that experience was before them,
and nearer than any one could dream.</p>

<p>“Come on, we had better be in a hurry,
Roger,” the other called out; “because already
it is getting pretty close to sunset, and with so
many clouds overhead, darkness is apt to come
along soon afterwards. And you know it isn’t
safe upon the big river after night sets in.”</p>

<p>They were quickly at the little cove where
the dugout had been left, and, much to their
satisfaction, they found everything all right.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that bear didn’t get a scent of our
fish while he was hurrying home,” Dick remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” the other boy added, “because
we happen to know how hungry they are for
fish, lots of times. Didn’t we see one scoop a
fish out with his paw, once, as he squatted on a
log that ran down into the water? But are we
going to risk it out there on the river just yet,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“It looks pretty rough, I declare; but the
waves are going down every minute, so we had
better wait a while. Given half an hour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
we ought to be able to cross. The longer we
can hold off, the easier our passage will be.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s no use throwing out a line
again?” mused Roger, whose passion for fishing
could never be wholly satisfied.</p>

<p>“Not after such a heavy rain, and with the
river rising as it is, Roger. You know enough
about fish to remember that they never bite
after a rain that washes all sorts of feed into
the river, and muddies the water so. Here, we
can sit down on this rock, and talk a little.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Dick, I know that you have something
on your mind that’s been worrying you
all day. More than once I’ve come near asking
what ailed you, and then I held my tongue for
fear I might offend. And at our house I notice
that father and mother seem worried, too, for
they often stop talking when I come in, and
look confused, as if they didn’t want me to
know what was wrong. Now, if you know, tell
me. We’re pretty well grown, and ought to
take some of the burdens on our shoulders, it
seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Well spoken, Roger, and shake hands with
me on that!” exclaimed the older lad, while his
sober face lighted up with a mingling of regard
for his cousin, and delight over hearing these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
words spring from his heart. “Yes, you are
right, we <i>are</i> old enough to be taken into the
councils of our parents; and my father has
thought the same, for he told me the nature of
the gloom that seems to be hanging over the
whole little Armstrong settlement of late.”</p>

<p>“And will you tell me, Dick?” demanded
the other, eagerly, while a look akin to resolution
flashed over his handsome face. Roger
was his father in his younger years over again;
a real “chip of the old block,” gentle-hearted,
brave, and with only the fault of recklessness
to mar his good record.</p>

<p>Sandy Armstrong in early life had taken as
his model that sterling young borderer known
in the history of the “dark and bloody
ground,” Kentucky, as Daniel Boone’s most
beloved helper, Simon Kenton; and, as their
natures were very much alike, the reason for
his admiration had always been very evident.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dick went on to say, bravely, “because
my father said he thought both of us
should know; not that he had any idea we could
do anything to help; but, if the blow fell, we
might be better prepared to stand it.”</p>

<p>“Blow fell!” repeated the other, in sheer
astonishment, while his ruddy face lost a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of its color; “why, what can you mean, Dick?
Are the Indians going on the warpath; or has
that precious wampum belt been lost again, as
father told me once happened when he was a
boy?”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“No, it is nothing like that, Roger,” replied
the other. “It concerns the title to the property
our parents bought years ago, and which
has been our home all of our lives, up to now.”</p>

<p>“Why, you surprise me, Dick! They bought
it, I have heard, from the French traders who
owned the section across the river, the pick of
the land above the St. Louis settlement.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is a fact, Roger; but it seems
that there is some sort of defect in the title,
and an old French trader, François Lascelles
by name, with his grown son, Alexis, has
threatened to turn us out of our homes by the
first of next year, unless we make a new settlement
with him, and purchase the ground for a
second time. It seems, however, that there is
just one way by which the land may be saved.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am glad to hear that; and if there
is anything that I can do, only tell me, and see
how quickly I will do it. But it would nearly
kill my mother to lose the farm now, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
she loves the place so much. Now, tell me what
that one thing is.”</p>

<p>“Listen. It seems that there is a man
whose signature to certain papers is necessary
in order to keep this rascal of a Frenchman
from seizing the property by the first of next
year. His name is Jasper Williams, and he is
a hunter and scout very much like Daniel
Boone, the friend of our parents. Both your
father and mine have been to great trouble
trying to locate this man, and, Roger, think of
the bitter disappointment that overwhelmed
them upon discovering a few days ago that he
is far away in the unknown West, but expects
to join the Lewis and Clark exploration party
that started out many weeks ago, bound to
cross prairies and mountains, and rivers and
lakes if necessary, until they finally set eyes
on the Pacific Ocean, which we know lies hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of miles away from
the Mississippi.”</p>

<p>Roger shook his head, as if overwhelmed
with sadness.</p>

<p>“Why, they may not be back again for two
years, even if they escape the thousand and one
perils they must encounter from wild beasts,
hostile Sioux and Blackfeet Indians, snow pitfalls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the mountains, starvation on the
deserts, and all sorts of other things. Oh!
Dick, what a cruel thing this is. And it could
all be changed, you say, if only that one man’s
signature might be obtained to a certain
paper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so father tells me. And, Roger, do
you know what I have been thinking of all this
day, while we sat, and fished, and watched the
coming of the storm?”</p>

<p>His impulsive cousin glanced up at him
quickly, an eager glow in his eyes and a set
look on his young face.</p>

<p>“Dick, were you thinking that <i>we</i> might
start out, and try to overtake that expedition
which President Jefferson has sent to see what
our new territory between the river and the
ocean is like? (<a id="Note_2r"></a><a href="#Note_2">Note 2</a>.) Tell me, would such
an idea ever enter the head of so cautious a
fellow as Dick Armstrong when it might seem
to be only fit for a madcap like myself?”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes! but, Roger, think what the signing
of that paper would mean to all those we
love! Remember that, unless something is
done, we may lose our homes before another
spring, and our parents must start all over
again. And, if you stop and think, did not our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
fathers once make almost as dangerous a journey
into the unknown country of the Iroquois
Indians, at the time our Aunt Kate, their sister,
was stolen by a young chief?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, every word you say is true, Dick;
but the daring of it all staggers me. Do not
think for a second that I will hold back, if only
we can gain the consent of our parents to
making the trial. Think of starting out into
that wonderful unknown wilderness, where
white men have never until now placed a foot,
following in the track of Captain Lewis and
Captain Clark, with their little band of soldiers
and scouts, not more than forty souls, all told.
Oh! let us get back across the river right away,
Dick, because I want to beg my father to let me
go; and get grandfather to back us up, for he
says we are chips of the old blocks, and able to
hold our own anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, the wind has fallen enough, I think,
for us to make the trial; so jump into the dugout,
and we’ll paddle for the other shore,
Roger.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE CABIN OF BOB ARMSTRONG</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was still danger in crossing the broad
river in so small a boat as the clumsy dugout;
so that the two lads had to be constantly on
their guard against being caught broadside on,
when the waves and wind united to beat against
their craft.</p>

<p>Fortunately their voyage was almost in the
teeth of the elements, and they were not compelled
to expose the side of the boat.</p>

<p>Dick always sat in the stern, as he was considered
the captain and pilot, being better able
to judge of what was proper to do in emergencies
than Roger, since there was always a
chance of the latter becoming confused, as he
himself very frankly admitted.</p>

<p>On this occasion Roger was wild with impatience
to get home. What his cousin had just
told him had excited him more than anything he
had ever heard; and the wonderful prospect
that opened to them, if they could obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
consent of their parents to follow after the
President’s expedition in search of the distant
Pacific, known only to Balboa’s party long,
long before, thrilled him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/i054.jpg" width="321" height="500" alt="fighting rapids in canoe" />
<div class="caption">“ONCE EVEN DICK’S BEST WORK COULD NOT PREVENT THE DUGOUT FROM TURNING PARTLY, SO AS TO EXPOSE A SIDE TO THE WIND.”</div>
</div>

<p>No doubt it affected his paddling to some
extent, for Dick noticed that he dipped deeper,
and made more vigorous strokes, than he could
ever remember Roger doing. In fact, he was
put to his best efforts to counteract the
“swing” that these furious efforts on the
part of the head paddler gave the boat.</p>

<p>Once even Dick’s best work could not prevent
the dugout from turning partly, so as to
expose a side to the wind, and they came very
near capsizing.</p>

<p>“Careful, Roger! Not so much ginger in
your stroke! We’ll get there in good time, if
only you keep up a steady gait. There are no
Indians after us, and the supper horn has not
blown yet, that I have heard!” Thus Dick
chided his impetuous cousin.</p>

<p>After that the other lad, as though himself
realizing the folly of allowing his excitement
to have such sway over his actions, managed to
moderate his speed and they had no more
trouble.</p>

<p>Besides, the nearer the boat drew to land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the more shelter they obtained from the fact
that the shore was covered with trees, which
broke the force of the wind, so that presently
they were in comparatively calm waters.</p>

<p>They ran their boat upon a shelving beach,
where it was usually kept when the stage of
water permitted. The painter was secured to
a stake that had been driven into the ground,
after which the two boys climbed the bank, and
headed for home.</p>

<p>“After you’ve had a talk with your parents,
when supper is done, get them to come over to
grandfather’s cabin for a grand powwow,”
said Dick, as he and Roger were about to separate.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” replied the other;
“and, if ever I wished for anything in all my
life, it’s that they may say ‘yes.’ I’ll never
be happy unless they do, because it would be a
glorious thing if we could find that man,
Jasper Williams, and get his signature to the
paper that will save our homes.”</p>

<p>Dick was a boy of few words. He seldom
gave expression to his feelings after the more
boisterous manner of his cousin, but the hearty
grip which he gave Roger’s hand at parting
was more expressive than words, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
boy knew that his own sentiments were echoed
in the heart of his companion.</p>

<p>There were three log cabins not far from
each other in the clearing. The middle one of
these belonged to Grandfather David Armstrong,
the original settler of the place, while,
on either side, his two sons, at the time of
their marriages, had built homes of a similar
type.</p>

<p>They had secured a grant of land that embraced
many rich acres, and which, when the
settlement of St. Louis grew in size, would become
more and more valuable. Knowing this
fact, then, it can be seen how the prospect of
having their land taken away by a defect in the
title affected the Armstrongs, young and old.</p>

<p>Dick strode straight to his own cabin home.
He was carrying with him as many of the fish
as he could well manage, and expected to send
his younger brother, Sam, back to the boat to
get the balance of what they had caught.</p>

<p>The night was just settling down, though it
would not be dark for some time yet, as the
long days had come in with the month of June,
which was now not far from its close.</p>

<p>In the west the glow of the sunset still
lingered and once again did Dick Armstrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
stop for a brief interval to stare at the touches
of gold and crimson that flecked the heavens.
No doubt the lad was vaguely wondering
whether he and his cousin would be allowed to
start forth to pierce that unknown wilderness
lying under that mysterious sky; and, if so,
what wonderful sights might they not set eyes
on during the weeks and months of their absence,
while trying to find Jasper Williams!</p>

<p>Some such strange thoughts must have been
passing through his mind, for he gave vent to
a long-drawn sigh as he once more started for
the cabin, from the small windows of which
shone a cheery light.</p>

<p>Even as he drew near, the door opened, and
the form of a woman was outlined as she stood
there, evidently looking out into the gloaming.
It was Dick’s mother, anxious, as any good
mother would be, concerning her boy, who
might have been upon the wild and riotous
Missouri at the time that summer squall first
broke.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Dick?” she called out eagerly,
seeing a figure approaching.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” came the reply; “we had
to wait till the waves went down some, before
trying to cross; because, you see, the old dugout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
is a clumsy thing in a heavy sea. But we
came over without shipping much water, and
with plenty of fish. I’ll leave them in the shed
here, and wash up before I come in.”</p>

<p>But, before doing so, Dick, who knew how
anxious his mother must have been during the
gale, went up and kissed her.</p>

<p>A short time later he entered the house. The
interior of the cabin was like all of its kind.
To the boys of the present generation it would
doubtless have seemed a very poor makeshift
for a home, since so many of the comforts to
which they are accustomed were lacking; but
in the eyes of Dick Armstrong it meant everything;
and with father, mother, and his
brother, Sam, present, he could wish for nothing
more.</p>

<p>The fire burned brightly on the wide hearth,
where the simple supper was cooking. From
the heavy rafters overhead hung strings of
herbs, and onions, and such things as the good
housewife of those days deemed necessary for
the welfare of her household. There was also
a ham, home-cured; and some strips of dried
venison, buffalo meat and even portions of a
young bear that Dick had shot during the preceding
fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>White dimity curtains at the windows gave
the room a homelike air. The younger boy was
oiling several traps that he meant to store
away until, with the coming of the crisp frosty
air, the next season for taking pelts would have
arrived. The father, who has been known in
earlier stories concerning this pioneer family
as Bob Armstrong, was engaged in reading a
newspaper from the Far East that had come
to old David, and was such a rarity that it was
passed from hand to hand, until decrepit from
age and much handling.</p>

<p>Bob had developed into a sturdy man. As
has been stated before, he had married the
daughter of another settler, whose home was in
St. Louis; and made both a good husband and
a kind father. Being industrious, he was by
degrees developing the farm that had come to
him as his share of the grant secured by David
Armstrong from the French company owning a
greater part of the land around the new settlement.
Even now they were getting good crops,
and had a barn in which these could be stored.</p>

<p>Taken all in all, this Armstrong settlement
was the most thrifty within fifty miles; and
people who saw the fields of grain, as well as
the animals raised upon the several farms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
said that David and his two sons deserved
great credit for their persistent energy.</p>

<p>Evidently supper had been waiting on account
of the absence of the older boy, for Mrs.
Armstrong immediately began serving it,
piping hot. If there was not a great variety on
the board, at least one could not complain on
account of the quantity.</p>

<p>Bob was impatient to hear an account of the
fishing excursion, and while the meal went on
Dick entertained them all with the story of how
he and his cousin happened on the den of the
bear in the big hollow oak and, seeking refuge
from the storm there, had been surprised by
the return of the owner, with the result that
they were compelled to treat Mr. Bear rather
meanly in order to induce him not to crowd in
on them.</p>

<p>Young Sam laughed heartily as he heard the
particulars; and even Bob seemed to be vastly
amused. No doubt it brought many a similar
scene back to his mind, connected with those
days in the past when two other boys, himself
and his brother Sandy, roamed the woods and
valleys in search of game, and met with many
surprising adventures by field and flood.</p>

<p>Dick purposely refrained from saying a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
concerning the bold scheme which he and Roger
had conceived, until after the meal was over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong was washing up the dishes,
and Sam still busily engaged with his traps,
with which he and Dick had done good work
during the previous winter, when, unable to
hold in any longer, Dick sprung his surprise.</p>

<p>“Father, there’s something I want to talk
with you about,” he began; and Bob, realizing
from the sober tone in which his son spoke that
it could be no trifling matter, laid down the
paper, and looked at the boy’s flushed face.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, Dick?” he asked, uneasily;
while the mother stopped her work to
glance up, and even Sam laid his trap down on
the floor, and listened.</p>

<p>“While we were sitting there on the shore,
waiting for the wind to quiet down a bit, so we
could take chances and cross over, Roger and I
got to talking. I told him all you said to me
about the shadow that has fallen on our homes
here, and, father, Roger, in his impetuous way,
declared that we ought to follow up the Lewis
and Clark company, to find that man, Jasper
Williams, and get his signature to the paper
that will save our land from being taken away.
And, father, as I heard Roger say that, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in me seemed to rise up and declare that
such was our duty. I promised him to get you
to go over to Grandfather Armstrong’s cabin
after supper, where we could have a council of
war, and see if something could not be done to
let us two go on this mission!”</p>

<p>When Dick stopped speaking a silence fell
upon them all. Father and mother exchanged
quick glances, and there were tears in their
eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>A GRAND PALAVER</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh!</span> Dick, my boy, we could not let you go
from us in that way!”</p>

<p>Of course Dick had expected that his mother
would say something like this; but he looked
more to his father for the consent that would
mean so much. The very thought was staggering
to those loving hearts; but in those days
boys of fifteen and sixteen were so accustomed
to thinking and doing for themselves that they
were fully trusted by their elders. And, besides,
mothers had been brought up in the hard
school of experience, thus learning early in life
to look upon danger as an ever-present thing.</p>

<p>If his father could be brought to see the
desperate undertaking in the right light, Dick
knew that the victory was as good as won; for
the former would be able to convince the good
wife and mother that it was, after all, a reasonable
conclusion, as well as the sole hope of
saving their imperiled homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob Armstrong shook his head, even while
his eyes grew dim as they rested on Dick’s
eager face.</p>

<p>“God knows, your mother and I understand
and appreciate the motive that prompts you to
say that, my boy,” he said; “but we could not
accept the sacrifice that it would mean. If
there is no other way to save our farms, then
they must go, and we will have to take up some
new land, and start in afresh.”</p>

<p>“But, father, why should you feel that
way?” the lad went on to say. “Can you not
trust me in the woods? Have I ever failed to
take every precaution, and up to now has anything
serious ever happened to me?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not that, son,” replied Bob; “a
man could not wish to have a better boy than
you have always been, and I wager you know
more woodcraft right now than either your
Uncle Sandy or myself had in our heads at your
age. But it would not be right for us to stay
comfortably at home here, while our sons were
meeting with all manner of perils off in that
unknown country.”</p>

<p>Dick smiled on hearing that. He believed
that, if there was no stronger argument against
the venture, his case was already as good as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
won. And, having thought it all out, he now
proceeded to knock away the props from under
the structure founded by his father.</p>

<p>“Please look back, father, to your own boyhood
days,” he said, soberly. “How many
times have you sat there, and told us of how
you and Uncle Sandy started out by yourselves
on the trail of that young Iroquois chief who
carried Aunt Kate away. Yes, you followed
him clear to the Great Lakes, to the country
that was teeming with enemies. And, in spite
of every peril, you and my uncle, with only the
help of that old trapper Pat O’Mara, since
gone to the Happy Hunting Grounds, and the
friendly Indian, Blue Jacket, did rescue Aunt
Kate, and even saved the life of Pontiac, who
afterwards gave you the magic wampum belt
that has kept us from harm all these years.
Father, what I am saying is all true, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, every word of it, my son; but,
then, the conditions were different at that
time,” replied the other, hastily. “Our sister
had been carried off, my father was far away
on the road to Virginia on important business,
and there was no one else to go in search of
Kate, so brother Sandy and myself <i>had</i> to start
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! yes, but you went willingly, eagerly,
I know, father, just as we feel like doing now,”
the boy went on.</p>

<p>“But the life and happiness of our only
sister was at stake, Dick,” the father said, and
yet in a half hesitating way, as though the argument
of the boy was already beginning to
have its effect.</p>

<p>“Well, the future happiness of <i>three</i> families
is at stake now, father. And if in those
days you and Uncle Sandy could face the perils
of the wilderness, and win out, why should not
Roger and I do the same now? All we would
have to do would be to follow up the course of
the river, week after week, until we caught the
expedition; and then keep on with them until
Jasper Williams joined them, as he expects to
do by the time they reach the Mandan country.
After that, having secured his signature to the
paper, we could bring it back to you. Why,
what could be easier than that? And think of
all it means to us, father!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I understand, Dick, and Heaven
knows I feel like giving my consent. But it is
no light matter, to be settled off-hand in a
minute. I have your mother’s feelings to consider.
She would be loath to see you leave us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and plunge into that unknown country that lies
toward the setting sun.”</p>

<p>“But, father, I have heard you say many
times that you often had a longing yourself
to go there, and if you were not the head of a
family the temptation might have been more
than you could stand. Yes, and Uncle Sandy
echoed your words, and looked forlorn for a
whole day, as though he had to light with the
desire to once more become a pioneer, and explore
new countries.”</p>

<p>Bob Armstrong smiled, and glanced toward
his wife, who shook her head, not trusting herself
to speech. But Dick felt encouraged, and
believed he had made great progress toward
gaining the consent of both parents.</p>

<p>There remained one trump card to play—Grandfather
Armstrong, who always sympathized
with his grandsons in their ambitions,
and who would be apt to look back to those
days when he, as a father, trusted his own sons
in every undertaking that could happen in the
lives of young pioneers along the Ohio and the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>“By now, Uncle Sandy and Roger must be
over at Grandfather Armstrong’s cabin; and
I promised that we would meet them there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a talk. You will not object to hearing what
he has to say, father, I hope?” Dick went
on.</p>

<p>“I can see what the result will be if Grandfather
takes a hand in it,” remarked Bob, with
a shrug of his shoulders; “but then, it seems
to be a case of ‘old men for council; young
men for war,’ and we surely ought to listen to
what he has to say of the project, after he has
heard both sides.”</p>

<p>The younger boy, Sam, who had been listening
to all this amazing talk with eagerness,
now broke in with:</p>

<p>“But I can shoot a rifle as well as Dick, and
know lots about trailing, and all those things
Pat O’Mara used to teach me before he died;
why must I stay at home if Dick goes,
father?”</p>

<p>“That would never do!” declared Dick,
immediately. “Mother could not stand the
absence of both her boys at the same time.
Who would do the hunting and fishing then,
while father worked the farm? Where would
the meat come from, Sam? No; if I go, you
must take my place, and show what you can do.
Besides, while you are strong for your years,
a boy of twelve could hardly expect to keep up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with those who are so much older. Oh! no, it
would not do at all.”</p>

<p>Sam was inclined to protest, but he saw his
mother’s grieved face; and something there
seemed to give his heart a wrench. Perhaps
it was the thought of being separated from her
by hundreds of miles of wilderness, never, perhaps,
to see her again in this life; for, after
all, Sam was only a very young boy, and he had
not been tried so severely as his father and
uncle in their early days.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I suppose I’ll have to stay home,
and take your place, Dick; but some fine day
I mean to see that Golden West for myself,
remember that,” he said, and, somehow, his
taking it for granted that the parents’ consent
was sure to be given to his brother’s daring
project did more to hasten the decision than
anything that had as yet occurred.</p>

<p>“Come,” remarked Bob, “let us all go to
Grandfather Armstrong’s, and talk it over. I
want to see what Sandy thinks, before I make
up my mind;” but Dick knew from his father’s
manner that already he had been partly won
over.</p>

<p>So they all trooped out, and were soon entering
the central cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>David Armstrong was now getting quite old.
Thirty years had passed since he came down
the Ohio on a flatboat, seeking a new home in
the wilderness; and his hair was as white as
the snows that came with each succeeding
winter. He was not able to do much manual
labor himself, but hired help to look after his
extensive holdings, that already had increased
ten times in value, and would be worth a fortune
later on, if they could only manage to retain
possession of them.</p>

<p>Evidently the old man and his wife had been
told of the bold proposition which Dick and
Roger had made, for his dimmed eyes rested
fondly on his other grandson as Dick entered
the big cabin.</p>

<p>David loved these boys even as he had his
own sons. He had watched their growth into
young manhood, and in every way fostered
their good traits. And, knowing what they
were capable of doing, if any one was able to
decide whether they could be entrusted with
such a dangerous mission it should be Grandfather
Armstrong.</p>

<p>Sandy was almost as sturdy a man as his
brother Bob, and his wife was a fine helpmeet
for a pioneer. There was none her equal in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that region when it came to putting up sweets
for the long winter season and in carrying out
the numerous responsibilities that a housewife
in those times had to take upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>But just now Phoebe Armstrong seemed
dumb with the dread that had seized her, after
hearing what an undertaking her only boy proposed
embarking upon.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate, too, was there, a buxom young
woman, who had helped to mother all the children
of her two brothers as they came along;
and now took upon herself many of the duties
that were proving too arduous for her mother,
not so strong as in the years long gone by.
And the last member of the group was little
Mary, Sandy’s daughter, a winsome child of
seven, with flaxen hair, and eyes rivaling the
blue skies and who, as already mentioned, had
been named after Grandmother Armstrong.</p>

<p>And then the grand “powwow,” as Roger
called it, began, the boys stating their case, and
begging hard to be allowed to carry out the
plan they had set their hearts on. Both fathers
also entered into the discussion, but the
mothers only listened, rather white of face, but
evidently willing that such an important matter
should be settled by the heads of the houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>All the while Grandfather Armstrong sat
there, smoking his long pipe, and listening to
what was said. And after all had been argued,
fathers and boys seemed to turn toward the old
man for a decision.</p>

<p>Removing his pipe, David Armstrong looked
around at the row of eager as well as anxious
faces, and, speaking slowly, delivered himself
of his decision.</p>

<p>“I think,” he said, very solemnly, “that
these brave boys should be allowed to show
what they are made of, and try to save for
their parents the homes we have planted here
in this beautiful spot. And so, let them make
the venture!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>BAD NEWS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Have</span> you come to tell me what they have
decided, Dick?” asked Roger, on the following
afternoon, when his cousin overtook him on the
river bank, where he had gone to work halfheartedly
on a new dugout which the boys were
fashioning from an especially fine log selected
by Bob himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, father just came in to tell me that he
and Uncle Sandy had finally determined that,
since we were so set upon trying to save the
farms, they could not stand in the way,” replied
the other, who was almost out of breath.</p>

<p>Roger threw his hat high in the air, and his
face broke out in a smile, as he let a whoop
escape him that would have done credit to
some Pottawatomie brave, eager to go upon the
warpath.</p>

<p>“That’s the best news you could have
brought me, Dick!” he exclaimed. “And how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
you fooled me with your long face. My heart
seemed to drop away down in my moccasins,
because I was afraid they had said ‘no.’ But
I had a heap of faith in Grandfather Armstrong,
and he was with us from the beginning.
When can we start, Dick? Oh, the hours will
drag like lead till we are off! Not that I won’t
suffer because of leaving mother and father
and all the rest; but it means so much to everybody.
And, Dick, do you think we will succeed?
Can we overtake Captain Lewis, after
he’s had so long a start? And will Jasper
Williams be there to sign that paper?”</p>

<p>His cousin laughed at the flood of eager
questions.</p>

<p>“One at a time, Roger,” he remarked, holding
the other at arms’ length. “They will not
think of letting us off under two days, because
our mothers will want to get so many things
ready for us to take. But what does a little
delay matter, when we know that we are going
to take the great trip? Think of how every boy
in the settlement will envy us, and wish he could
go along. But this is too serious a business to
think of taking any company with us. They
would not have anything at stake, and might
feel like backing down when troubles came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
while we do not mean to let anything hold us
back.”</p>

<p>Roger turned, and looked toward the west.
That was always the “unknown country” to
the American pioneer, even when the first of
them climbed the Alleghanies, and from their
tops saw the sun sink behind the forests beyond.
It held mysteries that the eyes of white
men had as yet never rested upon. Could there
be a more enticing prospect to lure adventurous
lads forward than this piercing of the wilderness,
day after day, moving ever onward
toward the distant shore of the Pacific, of
which they had heard such great stories,
handed down from the lips of those who had
perhaps gazed upon the western sea in the
East Indies; or it might be from the narrow
isthmus down where the waves of the Caribbean
Sea washed the shores of the Spanish
Main.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day. Fleecy white clouds
dotted the blue sky. Here a white-headed eagle
soared round and round in great circles, sailing
ever upward toward the sun. Far out upon
the water a fish-hawk or osprey was hovering
with winnowing wing, preparatory to darting
down to clutch some unlucky fish in its talons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
after which, possibly, the “lord of the air”
might attack the hawk, and force a surrender
of the finny prey, after the manner of all
eagles, even to this day.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to breathe the fresh air,
and be thankful that one lived. Add to this
the realization that a dream was about to come
true, such as no boy had ever dared indulge
before, and the feelings of Roger Armstrong
can be partly understood.</p>

<p>No wonder his boyish face shone with happiness.
True, there would be tearful partings
from those he loved; but then, his heart was
staunch, and he knew he could stand that. And
the wonderful mission that beckoned them forward,
was not that enough to pay for any
trouble and suffering they might meet?</p>

<p>“How do you suppose they will say we
ought to follow the expedition, Dick?” he
finally found tongue to ask, at the same time
casting a dubious look in the direction of the
dugout upon which he had been working.</p>

<p>Seeing that look, Dick burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, if it depended on our paddling that
heavy craft hundreds and hundreds of miles
up the swift current of the Missouri, making
a carry every now and then, perhaps, and going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ashore every night to camp, I don’t think
we’d ever come up with those French Canadian
voyageurs who handle the three boats Captain
Lewis has with him. You remember how we
followed them all one morning when they
passed here, and how badly we felt after they
had disappeared around the big bend above.
And it seems almost too good to be true to
think that we are going after them, perhaps to
be in their company a long time.”</p>

<p>“But answer my question, please, Dick; if
not by boat, then how shall we overtake the expedition,
which must be a hundred or more
miles away by now?”</p>

<p>“There is only one way, Roger. Our
fathers have decided that we shall start out
with horses, one each to ride, and another for
a pack animal, to carry some of the things we
may want on the long journey. I did not think
we would need these last; but I said nothing,
for it pleases our mothers to think that we may
carry plenty of good things along. But between
us, Roger, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised
if we had to abandon our packhorses before
we’ve been a week on the trail, and trust to the
fleetness of our own animals’ heels to keep
ourselves from being made prisoners by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the Indian tribes whose country we have to
pass through.”</p>

<p>Even this dismal prophecy did not appear to
affect the impulsive Roger. Indeed, his eyes
sparkled more than ever, as though he rather
enjoyed the prospect of being thrown on his
own resources. It was going to be a fine opportunity
to learn the value of those secrets of
woodcraft which he had picked up from time
to time.</p>

<p>From the early days of history, the prospect
of adventure has appealed to all boys with red
blood in their veins. Only for that eagerness,
shown by the early pioneers, to pit themselves
against the perils of the wilderness, how would
our frontier line have been extended, year
after year, until it finally broke over the
mighty Rockies, and reached the western sea?</p>

<p>“But two whole days,” Roger muttered,
“they will seem ever so long to me, Dick. I
wish it could be to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but there is plenty to be done, for all
of us,” replied the more thoughtful lad; “I’ll
see to it that you have no idle minutes on your
hands from this time out. To begin with,
Roger, pick up your tools, and bring them to
the house. All work on this boat must be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
off until our return, unless Sam chooses, with
the help of Grandfather, to finish it, which I
rather think will be the case.”</p>

<p>They turned their back upon the river, but
it would be in their minds always. Indeed,
they must expect to follow its erratic course
over plains and through valleys, heading
into the northwest continually, until in due
time they might hope to overtake those who
had gone before, with horses, and boats, and
all manner of stores, intended to placate, it
might be, the hostile and suspicious tribes that
had never before set eyes on a white man.</p>

<p>Yes, those were busy hours with every one.
Even Sam felt that he must do what little he
could. The hunting could wait until after his
brother had said his last good-by, and ridden
away into the west—time enough for all that;
but just now he wanted to see all he could of
Dick, who had never seemed half so dear as
when he was about to go away.</p>

<p>Sad hours they were for the parents of both
lads, though they endeavored to conceal it.
The mothers shed their tears in secret, not
wishing to display any weakness. Now that
the matter had been settled they were like the
staunch Roman mothers of old, who could with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dry eyes send their sons forth to battle, keeping
all display of womanly weakness for their
own rooms.</p>

<p>The horses that were to be taken had been
selected, and every detail of saddles and
bridles looked after before the first full day
had gone. Bob and Sandy Armstrong saw to
these things themselves. Their former experience
in the forest was of great value in this
emergency, for they knew just what ought to
be taken by their sons, from extra flints in
order to ensure fire, and for the rifles, to
blankets needed on the nights when perhaps
they would be exposed to chilling winds and
storms, far up in a mountainous country.</p>

<p>By the time the next day was over, the preparations
had gone on so well that the boys had
gained the consent of their parents to making
the start at noon of the following day, which
would give them several hours’ gain on the
original plan of campaign.</p>

<p>Charts or plans of the country there were
none, for no whites had penetrated more than
a hundred miles or so to the westward. It was
believed that many different tribes of Indians
lived along the upper Missouri, for from time
to time venturesome trappers had met roving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bands and picked up a certain amount of information
concerning the fierce Sioux, the
Blackfeet, the Mandans, and other nations that
warred against each other, and seemed to hold
certain sections of the country as their hunting
grounds, ready to fight any trespassers, be
they red or white.</p>

<p>Roger had gone down to the settlement of
St. Louis to carry out some errand entrusted
to him, and on his return it was seen that the
boy looked very much excited, as though he
might have heard news that concerned the mission
he and his cousin had agreed to carry out.</p>

<p>The others were gathered at the cabin of
Grandfather Armstrong, examining something
which the old man had brought out, and which
he wished the boys to take along with them on
their trip.</p>

<p>So Roger came hurrying up, and his excited
manner immediately drew the attention of
everybody. The first thing that struck Bob
Armstrong was that bad news might have been
received concerning the expedition of Captain
Lewis; for there had been many dismal
prophecies uttered that they would fall before
an overwhelming attack of hostile Indians before
they had been a month on the way, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
reached anywhere near the falls of the river
at the place where Atchison, Kansas, now
stands.</p>

<p>“Tell us the worst, son!” demanded Sandy,
as Roger reached the group. “Is it any evil
that has befallen our good friend, Captain
Lewis, and his gallant command?”</p>

<p>“No, not that, father,” replied the boy;
“but, would you believe it? that Frenchman,
François Lascelles, has been in St. Louis with
his son; and, learning of our mission, they
have already started, bent on finding Williams
before we can, and fixing it so that all our work
will be useless!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>OFF ON THE GREAT JOURNEY</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> hound!” exclaimed Sandy Armstrong,
with something of his old impetuosity.</p>

<p>“But, even as it is, we will outwit him,”
Dick observed, with that quiet resolution that
was so distinctly a part of his character.
“They can only have a day or so the start of
us; and it may not be so hard to get ahead of
his party in the thick of the woods.”</p>

<p>“And if he tries any of his tricks on us,”
broke in the indignant Roger, “be sure that
we will not spare him. We are going to remember
that he is a bad man, who plans to rob
us of our homes, and steal the property our
parents have built up here. Yes, it won’t be
such a fine day for Monsieur Lascelles when he
meets the Armstrong boys face to face; eh,
Dick?”</p>

<p>The bad news Roger had brought from the
settlement seemed to cast a shadow on the coming
separation of the boys from those they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
loved. The mothers sighed, and had hard work
to force a smile when either of the lads happened
to be near. Even the fathers got together
many times, and conferred as to
whether one of them should not accompany the
boys.</p>

<p>But it seemed as though fate had stepped in
to prevent. Sandy had recently been ill, and
had hardly recovered his strength; while Bob,
only a week before, had cut himself in the foot
with an axe, so that he would be hobbling
around for a month yet. And, under such conditions,
either one of them would prove a drag
on the movements of the boys.</p>

<p>And so it was finally decided that the original
plan must be adhered to, unless they intended
to change their minds entirely, and not allow
Dick and Roger to undertake the mission.</p>

<p>The news had the effect of sobering Roger
somewhat. He began to realize more than ever
that their venture was to be no jaunt, but a
serious matter, to call for the best efforts they
could put forth. Not only would they be exposed
to perils from wild animals, storms that
must sweep over the great mountains from time
to time, and constantly beset by the hostile Indians
whose territory they meant to invade;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
but here was a new danger in the vindictive
and lawless French trader, who would leave no
stone unturned to balk the accomplishment of
their mission.</p>

<p>Still, neither dreamed of turning back.
They were like old Israel Putnam—once his
hand was at the plow, nothing could swerve
him.</p>

<p>Their friends in the St. Louis settlement
proved most kind. Many came out to talk matters
over, and some to offer good advice concerning
the many difficulties they had heard of
in connection with the trail leading to the setting
sun. And one and all brought something
from their stores that they hoped the boys
might find room for among the packages to be
fastened on the packhorse.</p>

<p>It had been decided to take only one extra
horse along. Dick had been instrumental in
bringing about this decision. Although he advanced
other reasons, the truth of the matter
was that he expected they would have to abandon
any pack animal when dangers began to
thicken around them, and he did not want to be
the means of causing greater loss than was
necessary.</p>

<p>Besides, they could carry all they wanted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
one animal. There was a rude tent that had
seen much use, cooking utensils, blankets, some
extra clothing, stores intended for food, and
some trinkets that Grandfather Armstrong
supplied, such as beads and small looking-glasses,
which his experience told him might
be used to gain the good will of strange tribes
of Indians, to whom such trifles would appeal
strongly.</p>

<p>They could not have carried one-quarter of
the many articles that well-meaning women
friends of their mothers brought with them.
This was no junketing expedition, on which
they could start with a vast amount of preserves
and cakes and such dainties; but a most
serious business. They did not disdain to take
some of the pemmican, because that might
come in handy should they be passing through
a dangerous section of country, where it would
be risky to discharge a gun, lest by so doing
the sound bring a host of enemies upon
them.</p>

<p>Dick had listened to all the stories he could
concerning the wilderness far up the great
river. Then he had gone off by himself, and
tried to draw an imaginary chart that would
cover the ground. Upon this he had marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
all known points; and around any of which
there existed any doubt he always drew a circle,
to indicate that proof was needed.</p>

<p>No doubt this chart was a crude affair, and,
if seen nowadays, when every mile of the distance
has been measured and mapped by
geographers, it would cause a smile; but, in
the absence of anything definite, it gave the
boys a certain amount of confidence; and,
moreover, as they went along, and certain features
were proved to be grossly exaggerated,
they could make changes.</p>

<p>And if they were fortunate enough to come
back again, what pride they could take in exhibiting
that altered chart, which had been
built up week after week, as they pierced
farther and farther into the wilderness.</p>

<p>The eventful day dawned bright and clear.</p>

<p>It seemed a friendly omen to Dick Armstrong
as he went about his morning duties as
though nothing out of the ordinary was about
to take place, so well under control did the boy
hold himself.</p>

<p>They gathered in the big cabin of Grandfather
Armstrong for dinner, every soul of the
little settlement, and at the table the old man
asked that the blessings of Heaven might follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
those two bold lads as they started out
upon their adventure.</p>

<p>It would have been a cheerless meal indeed,
had not Dick taken things in hand, and joked
in a way quite unlike his usual self. But his
father and uncle understood how full the lad’s
heart was, and that he was forced to assume
such levity in order not to break down.</p>

<p>Finally the meal ended, but to most of those
who took part it was more like a funeral feast
than a banquet in spite of the good things
with which Grandmother Armstrong and Aunt
Kate had prepared.</p>

<p>And now the time had come to say good-by.</p>

<p>The horses were ready, fresh, and apparently
eager to be moving, unconscious of the
fact that in all probability they would never
more see the home stable.</p>

<p>Despite their efforts to appear gay, the
hearts of the boys seemed to be in their throats,
so that in the end, when it came each lad’s turn
to embrace his mother a second time, turning
to her last of all, neither Dick nor Roger could
utter a single word.</p>

<p>But boyish nature is apt to soon recover
from these things; and once they had shut out
the familiar scene, and turned their faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
toward the west, they gradually recovered their
customary spirits.</p>

<div class="caption">“AT THE EDGE OF THE WOODS THEY STOPPED THEIR HORSES, AND TURNED IN THE SADDLE TO WAVE A FAREWELL.”</div>
</div>

<p>At the edge of the woods they stopped their
horses, and turned in the saddle to wave a
farewell. Across the field there welled the
hearty calls of fathers and grandfather; while
the shrill voice of Sam bade them not to forget
that they had promised to fetch him back some
memento of the country on the upper reaches
of the Missouri, which some day, if he lived to
be a man, he meant to visit for himself.</p>

<p>“Ready, Roger?” asked Dick, in a husky
tone; for he knew that the sooner his impulsive
cousin were started, so that the trees
might shut out all view of those loved faces,
the better.</p>

<p>“Yes, come on, Dick!” answered the other,
gulping hard.</p>

<p>A word to the horses, and they were off.
The heavy woods immediately came between,
and, even though they turned in the saddle
again, nothing of their home could they see.</p>

<p>The boys rode at a fast pace, because it
seemed to agree with their spirits, just then,
and they felt that they wanted to place some
distance between themselves and home, possibly
lest their resolution fail them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>And in thus making their start upon such a
tremendous undertaking, what strange pictures
must have occupied the minds of the adventurous
pair, as they surveyed that uncertain
future, which might be peopled with such adventures
as mortals had never before dreamed
of meeting?</p>

<p>But, just as Dick had foreseen would be the
case, in half an hour both had seemingly recovered
their spirits and were looking hopefully
to the future to fulfill some of the many
dreams that had filled their minds ever since
the subject of the long journey had been
broached.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE TRACK OF THE MARKED HOOF</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What’s</span> gone wrong, Roger?”</p>

<p>“Our packhorse has disappeared in the
night; I’ve looked high and low for him, Dick,
but it’s no use.”</p>

<p>“Did you hobble him the way we had the
other animals fixed?” asked the other lad.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you know he always had a habit
of straying farther than either of the riding
horses; and the chances are he’s gone so far
now that he doesn’t know the way back. What
will we do about it, Dick; wait over and spend
the best part of a day looking for him; or
divide up the stuff, and get on?”</p>

<p>Impatient Roger undoubtedly would be for
the latter method of solving the question, if
left to his own devices. He was already tired
of the slow progress they seemed to have been
making in all these weeks they had been on
the go.</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place,” began Dick, “we
ought to make some sort of a hunt for the packhorse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
We’ve managed to keep him with us
so far, after some narrow shaves, and it would
be a great pity to let him go just because we
didn’t want to take the trouble to look him up.”</p>

<p>“But,” objected the other, “he may be
miles away from here by now.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Roger; if we find that such is
the case we can give the hunt up, and do the
next best thing. But let’s start out, and see
where his tracks lead.”</p>

<p>“But how are we to know which are the
tracks of the led animal, Dick?” queried
Roger. “Horses’ hoofs are pretty much the
same, seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, as a rule that is so,” came the
reply, with a confident smile; “but in this case
it happens that old Peter had a chip knocked
from the outside edge of his off hind hoof,
which always left a mark I could tell. I’ve noticed
it about a hundred times, and always
thought that, if the old stray ever did get away,
from us, with the stuff on his back, we could
easily follow his trail.”</p>

<p>“It takes you to notice all those things,
Dick; and yet I have a good pair of eyes, too,”
observed Roger, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“As good as mine, and perhaps better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Roger; but the trouble is you seldom use them
as much as you might. But come, let us start
out and see what there is to be found. And
look for the track with the outer edge sheared
off.”</p>

<p>The two boys had been in camp in a little
depression on the bank of the river, which they
had reached on the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p>At the time, the day had not been so far advanced
but that they could have gone a few
miles farther; but as soon as Dick had seen
this camping place he had surprised and partly
dismayed the eager Roger by expressing a desire
to put in the night there.</p>

<p>The reason for this became manifest later
on, when he showed his companion unmistakable
signs to prove that the expedition they
were following had, in fact, tied up there for
the night. There were numerous indications to
prove this—tracks of white men’s shoes, and
the moccasins of the guides and trappers accompanying
the soldiers; as well as the hoof
prints of the horses.</p>

<p>Of course, when he learned this fact Roger
was reconciled to wasting a little of their
precious time. He knew that they could discover
a variety of things while camping in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
same place that those who preceded them had
occupied.</p>

<p>And, after a careful examination of the
signs, with a remembrance of the fact that
quite a heavy rain had fallen two weeks before,
which would have washed away any tracks
made before its coming, both boys were convinced
that the expedition must have camped
here after that storm.</p>

<p>This was most important to the boys. It
assured them that they had gained remarkably
on Captain Lewis and his company, who had
had such a long start of them. If the expedition
had been here within two weeks, their
chances of overtaking it were excellent. Perhaps
in another week, or two at least, they
might expect to come upon the boats.</p>

<p>That anticipation had made Roger unusually
cheerful all through the preceding night. Indeed,
he even found difficulty in sleeping, and
had been on his feet numerous times after they
lay down in their blankets under the shelter of
the tent.</p>

<p>And now a new source of trouble had come
upon them. Old Peter, the packhorse, had a
habit of wandering off; and on several other
occasions Roger had been compelled to hunt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
him in the morning; but this time he seemed to
have disappeared for good.</p>

<p>Of course both lads took their rifles with
them when leaving camp. In those early days,
when one’s life often depended on prompt action,
and also on having the means of defence
handy, men and boys never neglected to keep
their firearms where they could lay a hand on
them at a second’s warning. Even when they
slept, Dick and his cousin kept their guns close
by, with a protecting arm generally thrown
over them, for they looked upon these weapons
as their best, indeed only, friends in this wild
country.</p>

<p>It took Dick but a minute or two to circle
around just outside the camp, and find the
track of the broken hoof. Just as he expected,
it soon began to edge away from camp. Old
Peter was evidently up to his tricks again, and
the grass must have seemed sweeter to him the
further he could roam away from the spot
where the tent had been pitched.</p>

<p>They followed the trail for a few minutes.
Then Dick came to a pause, and, screening his
eyes with his hand, looked keenly around.</p>

<p>“See any sign of the old rascal?” asked
Roger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must say I don’t,” came the answer;
“and, to tell the truth, I hardly like the idea
of wandering so far away from camp. While
we are gone some one might come along and
steal everything we own—horses, outfit and
all.”</p>

<p>“That would be a tough deal for us, Dick,”
remarked the other; “and for one I don’t
think it would pay us to take the chance for
the sake of such an old horse as Peter. But
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Go back and get our breakfast,” answered
Dick, promptly, as though he had been making
up his mind while they hunted for the tracks;
“then, if he doesn’t show up, we can load the
stuff on both our horses, and start out.”</p>

<p>“But that would be a pretty uncomfortable
way of doing, I’d say,” objected Roger, who
did not like the thought of riding perched on
top of the folded tent, and with all manner of
other things around him.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t mean to try it long,” the other
hastened to reply. “You see, it happens that
the trail leads up-river, so we could keep on
following it, and not leave our stuff unprotected.
Then, if we found Peter, it would be all
right; and, on the other hand, if we didn’t, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
had to give him up, I’ve a notion we’d better
get rid of a few things like the tent, and go on
our journey lighter.”</p>

<p>“It is pretty old, for a fact, and clumsy, too.
When that Indian brave sold the tent to us, he
played a smart trick, for the skins had been
exposed so long to sun and rain and wind that
they were getting weak. I won’t be sorry to
see the old affair kicked out. We’re used to
sleeping on the ground, and if it rains we can
make a shelter out of branches, or find a hole
in the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps a hollow tree,” added Dick,
laughingly, as they turned back toward camp.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, in that case we’ll try to make
sure it doesn’t happen to be the den of a bear,”
observed the other. “Every time I think of
that fellow about to drop down on us, it gives
me the shivers.”</p>

<p>On reaching the camp they hurried preparations
for breakfast. It was always a simple
meal, consisting of some meat or fish, cooked
over the small fire they had burning, and a dish
of tea, of which both boys happened to be very
fond. Coffee in those early days was almost
an unknown luxury among the Western pioneers
along the Missouri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had partaken of this frugal but
satisfying meal, the boys started to take down
the skin tent which had been the subject of
Roger’s remarks. It was an old Indian lodge,
and, while the figures of animals and hunting
scenes that once decorated its sides were pretty
well faded, enough remained to interest the
boys from time to time, and cause more or less
speculation as to what they were intended to
represent.</p>

<p>After they had managed to load all their
possessions on the backs of the two riding
horses, much to the surprise of the animals,
they said good-by to their night’s camp, and
once more started off, heading into the northwest,
and following the river.</p>

<p>Thus far much of their journey had been
over the level plains, although from time to
time they had been in the country of hills and
forests, as well as rocky sections.</p>

<p>It happened that they were just then in a
region where the woods came down to the
banks of the river; and in the open places grew
the grass upon which the hobbled horses had
fed during the night.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys thought to climb into
their saddles while following the marked trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of the missing packhorse; indeed, that would
have been next door to an impossibility, with
all those traps piled high on the animals’ backs.
They walked along ahead of the horses, keeping
their eyes for the most part on the trail.</p>

<p>“The old sinner, to think that he’d wander
all this way from where the others put in the
night,” Roger remarked, when they had kept
on for almost ten minutes.</p>

<p>“Still, he doesn’t show up ahead, as far as
I can see,” Dick observed, “and, if we fail to
sight him soon, we’ll have to say good-by to
Peter, because he’s beginning to bear away
from the river, and we don’t want to spend a
whole day looking for a poor old packhorse
which we’d soon lose, I reckon, anyway, when
we get in the region of the hostile Indians.”</p>

<p>He had hardly said this when he threw up
his hand.</p>

<p>“Stop a minute, Roger,” said Dick, bending
down, as though he had made a discovery that
aroused his deepest interest.</p>

<p>“What have you found—did Peter break
his hobble rope? For I notice you have picked
up a piece of it, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Look closer, and you will see that it has
been cut by something sharp, which I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
say must have been a knife,” the other went
on, hurriedly, yet with conviction in his voice;
“and, Roger, we might as well make up our
minds that Peter is gone for good, because here
are the imprints of moccasins in the soft earth;
an Indian must have run across our packhorse,
and carried him off!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>ALONG THE BANK OF THE MISSOURI</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> a shame!” exclaimed Roger, as
soon as he could speak.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, it might have been a lot worse,”
remarked Dick.</p>

<p>“You mean that we didn’t care very much
for old Peter, after all; is that it, Dick?” demanded
the other.</p>

<p>“Yes; and, besides, just think what a mess
we would have been in if it had been a party
of Indian thieves, and they’d made a clean
sweep of <i>all</i> our horses,” was the way Dick
consoled himself.</p>

<p>Of course his cousin quickly saw things in
the same light, as he generally did after Dick
had explained his views.</p>

<p>“How lucky,” he went on, “that we were
smart enough to build our little cooking fire
last night in that hollow, so it couldn’t have
been seen a hundred feet away. Only for that
this same horse thief must have found out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
where we had our camp, and tried for the
balance of our horses.”</p>

<p>“Well, how can we blame him for picking up
a stray animal that seemed to be wandering
around without an owner?” asked Dick. “I
heard an old trapper and trader tell Captain
Lewis one day, when I was hanging around the
camp near the settlement, that he would always
have lots of trouble keeping his horses;
for that was one thing the Indians coveted.
After this, we must not let our two animals
wander away.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” Roger returned, vigorously.
“Why, it wouldn’t take an Indian ten
seconds to throw a leg over one of our fine
horses, and be off like a flash. What would be
the use of firing after him, when we’d be just
as apt to hit the running animal? No, we’ll
simply have to be careful—more than ever,
now. To lose a horse would ruin our chances
for overtaking the expedition, wouldn’t it,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would,” replied the other, as
he started to take off the huge packages with
which each of their animals had been burdened.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” asked
Roger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“The first thing is to look over all this stuff,
and see what we can do without.”</p>

<p>As he said this Dick cast aside the Indian
tent that made quite a good-sized package of
itself, even when carefully folded.</p>

<p>Roger gave it a rueful glance, for he had
thought more than a little of that old affair.
Then he laughed in his quick, nervous way,
and on his own account began to toss things
from the back of the other horse.</p>

<p>Whenever he came to something concerning
which he seemed to be in doubt, Roger would
hold it up, and say:</p>

<p>“What about this, Dick; think we really
need it?”</p>

<p>In several cases his cousin was able to decide
without any consideration, for the boys
had thrust in a number of things that, so far,
they had found no need for, and probably
might not use at all. Some of these had associations
that they hated to break; but it
seemed absolutely necessary to reduce the
stock they carried. And so Dick would grimly
nod his head, and say:</p>

<p>“Throw it aside, Roger; no use talking, it’s
got to go. Our horses couldn’t undertake to
carry us and all this stuff, too. But I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
what we might do with it, and take a chance of
getting it back some time.”</p>

<p>“You must mean <i>cache</i> it, like the trappers
do some of their pelts, when they have more
than they can carry, and mean to come back
after the rest at some future time; is that it,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Just what I meant,” the other replied.
“You see, we can do up the lot inside this old
tent, and find a hollow tree to hide it in.”</p>

<p>“Close by the river, you mean, of course,”
added Roger, eagerly; for anything like this
always appealed to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, so that, when we come down again,
we can look for the mark we’ll remember, and
which may be a crooked tree bending over the
water, or something like that. Then we could
come ashore to get the package, if we’re drifting
in a boat, as may be the case. Captain
Lewis might want to buy our horses, you
know, if he has lost a number of his animals
through wild beasts, and thieving Indians.”</p>

<p>“But let’s be sure the hole in the tree is a
<i>small</i> one,” observed Roger, turning a laughing
face on his cousin.</p>

<p>“We will, you can be sure of that,” the
other assured him; “because, they tell me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bears are apt to make their dens in some of
these hollow trees; and we don’t want our
traps to be used for a bed quilt.”</p>

<p>So they sorted all the stuff over; and it was
wonderful how little they deemed indispensable.
Friends had brought so many things as
presents for the adventurous boys, when they
learned of the long journey which they projected,
that there were numerous duplicates in
their outfit, such as frying-pans, kettles and
even blankets.</p>

<p>Finally the task was completed, and the tight
bundle tied with cords, so that it could be
stowed away in some secret hiding-place, when
they discovered one that seemed to suit their
ideas.</p>

<p>After that the forward march was resumed,
though they made certain to keep close to the
bank of the river.</p>

<p>Before they left the spot Roger was seen to
once more bend over that imprint of a moccasin,
as though examining it.</p>

<p>“What new idea has struck you?” asked
his cousin, watching him closely.</p>

<p>“You may say it is foolish,” replied the
other, “but, do you know, Dick, I was wondering
whether this might not have been either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
François Lascelles, or his son, who had stolen
our horse, thinking to cripple us, and in that
way keep us from overtaking the expedition
of Captain Lewis.”</p>

<p>The suggestion caused Dick to knit his
brows, but he quickly shook his head.</p>

<p>“In the first place, while I’ve never met this
French trader, still, I’ve heard so much about
him that I feel sure he would never have rested
content until he had found our camp, so that
he could steal all our horses. No, Roger, this
was only a wandering Indian, who happened
to run across old Peter, and gobbled him up.
Look more closely at the footprint, and you
will see that it toes in very much. All Indians
walk that way, you know. Yes, some white
men do, I admit, but the wearing of moccasins
never makes them turn their toes in as Indians
do. This was a copper-colored fellow, I’d be
willing to stake my reputation on that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” remarked the other, giving up,
as he usually did after arguing for a short
time with Dick, “it doesn’t matter much,
anyway. The packhorse is gone, and we’ll
never see him again. Shall we start on, now,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“We might as well,” replied the leader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the little party, as he climbed into his seat with
some difficulty on account of the other burdens
loaded on the horse, “and remember that we
must keep our eyes on the lookout for some
place to hide that package.”</p>

<p>Roger had insisted on loading the “cast-offs”
on his horse, while he walked. It was
not going to be for long, he asserted, and he
could stand it; and so the other had let him
have his way, because he knew that Roger was
always happy when he could be doing something
for others.</p>

<p>They were not long in discovering the very
hiding-place they wanted in which to conceal
the tent and other things. And, as usual, it
was Roger’s keen eyes that caught sight
of it.</p>

<p>“Look over there, Dick. How would that
suit us?—that tree with the hump on its trunk,
I mean; see the hole just above the ground,
which, I take it, is large enough to hold all we
want to put in it. Then we can stuff stones in
afterwards, and block any animal from spreading
himself on our property.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and after that we must efface all signs
of what we’ve been doing,” declared Dick;
“because some Indian might happen to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
our trail and take a notion to follow it a space.
When he came up to this place he’d notice that
we had done something to that tree, and take
a look in. But then, we ought to know how to
do that, or else we’re mighty poor hunters.”</p>

<p>They had little difficulty in pushing the bundle
into the hollow, and then filling the balance
of the cavity with stones; finally removing all
traces of the fact that any human being had
been close to the marked tree.</p>

<p>After that they found a peculiar tree growing
on the river bank, which both noted carefully,
so that they believed they would have
little or no trouble in recognizing it again,
should the chance ever come to them, when returning
home. For at that time neither Dick
nor Roger dreamed how far afield they were
fated to roam before once more seeing the dear
ones they had left behind. It was their avowed
intention to overtake the expedition, find
Jasper Williams, get his signature, duly witnessed,
upon the paper; and then start back
down the river as fast as horses or current
could take them. The young pioneers did not
suspect how they would be tempted by circumstances,
and possibly continue in the company
of those gallant captains, Lewis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Clark, to the end of their long journey toward
the distant Pacific.</p>

<p>Once more they were able to move along
with something approaching speed, where the
buffalo trails through the forest followed the
river, as often happened. These animals did
not confine themselves to the vast plains altogether,
though they were to be found there in
great herds; pairs of them, often with young,
sometimes frequented woody spots, as though
they sought them to be free from the companionship
of their kind.</p>

<p>Several times, now, the boys had seen these
great animals crashing through the brush to
one side. They had not attempted to shoot
one, because it was thought best, while in the
country of hostile Indians, not to fire their
guns if it could be avoided, lest the unusual
sound bring trouble upon their heads. At this
time the redmen west of the Mississippi had
none of the “sticks that spit out fire, and
sting,” their weapons being chiefly bows
and arrows, spears, and war clubs; though
most of them carried rude knives, and tomahawks
made out of either stone, copper or some
flint-like wood.</p>

<p>Among the things which Roger had insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
on retaining, there happened to be an Indian
bow and arrows, which he had traded for a
year and more back. By dint of much practice
Roger had become quite expert in the use of
this stout bow, and could send his feathered
shafts with considerable accuracy. At home
he had brought down more or less game with
his arrows, including a savage hawk that had
seized a young chicken, and flown to a tree to
devour its prey.</p>

<p>Roger had insisted on fetching this outfit
along. He had ventured the prediction that it
would come in very handy, some time or other,
when they wanted to secure a stock of fresh
meat, and disliked using their rifles.</p>

<p>During the balance of the morning they continued
to follow the river pretty closely, though
at times they had to turn their backs on it,
since the buffalo trail they chanced to be following
at the time left the vicinity of the Missouri.
Both boys were willing to be guided by
the instinct of these animals, knowing that in
all probability there must be some swampy
section of ground ahead, which was thus
avoided.</p>

<p>At about noon they halted, and ate, though
not going to the trouble of starting a fire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
though either of the boys could have made one
out of wood so dry and well seasoned that the
smoke would not have been seen at any distance
away, such had been their forest training.</p>

<p>Then once more they were on the go. The
fact that the expedition had passed here only
a week or ten days ahead had given them considerable
satisfaction, for it told that they
were rapidly overtaking those whom they
wanted to join.</p>

<p>It had been their intention to keep moving
until nearly dusk, when they expected to look
for a suitable camping-place and settle down
for what they hoped would be a peaceful night.</p>

<p>The sun was quite low in the western
heavens when Dick, who happened to be in the
advance, drew in his horse, and made a movement
with his arm that brought the other to a
full stop. Both boys slipped from their saddles,
and came together, Roger with alarm
written upon his face, until he saw that his
companion, while excited, looked rather
pleased.</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t Indians?” whispered Roger,
laying a hand on the other’s arm.</p>

<p>“No,” came the low reply; “but I just
happened to glimpse a little band of elk, feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in an open glade. And as we haven’t had
any fresh meat for three days the idea struck
me, Roger, that perhaps this is the chance for
you to make use of your Indian bow and
arrows!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE TWANG OF A BOWSTRING</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I’d</span> like to do that first-rate,” Roger replied,
at the same time passing hastily over
to his horse, in order to get the bow, with his
quiver of arrows.</p>

<p>“It just happens, luckily,” Dick whispered,
having fastened his horse to a tree, “that the
wind is in our favor, because we’re to leeward
of the elk, and they will not get scent of you
creeping up.”</p>

<p>“How about cover?” asked Roger, as, with
a hand that trembled a little in spite of his
efforts to appear calm, he commenced to bend
the stout hickory bow on his knee, and slip the
loop of cord over the notched end.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to pick your own as you find
it,” came the reply. “I didn’t have a chance
to see what it was like; but there ought to be
some way to creep close up, so as to get in a
shot. I only hope you manage to put an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
arrow where it will count. Some elk steaks
would taste pretty fine, let me tell you,
Roger.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my level best,” was the reply of
the archer, as, having arranged the otterskin
quiver over his left shoulder, so that he could
quickly pull out a second feathered shaft,
should it be needed in a hurry, he fitted the
one he had retained to the bowstring, and then
prepared to advance toward the spot where
Dick had noted the feeding elk.</p>

<p>“Easy, now, Roger,” for Dick knew the
other’s failings, and many a time had his admonition
stilled a tumult in the heart of the
nervous lad, causing him to get a grip on himself,
and come out of some enterprise with
credit.</p>

<p>Roger was a born hunter, at least. Few
border lads could creep up on a suspicious
quarry more quietly than he. Part of this
was an inherited trait; but he had also been
much in the company of a young Indian brave
who used to visit at the St. Louis settlement
before his people went further West; and
from him Roger had picked up many valuable
points.</p>

<p>He now bent down, and glided noiselessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
along until he could see through an opening in
the underbrush, when he, too, caught sight of
the elk.</p>

<p>The sight thrilled the young hunter, and
caused him to shut his teeth hard together as
he resolved to do his very best to get in a fatal
shot. The fact that he knew his cousin would
surely be watching him seemed to lend Roger
additional faculties; and when he finally
dropped down, and commenced to do his creeping,
he was in a mood to excel all previous
efforts.</p>

<p>Once in a while, as he “snaked” his way
from bush to bush, taking advantage of every
possible screen, the lad would lift his head
just a little to take an observation. And thus
he learned that there were three elk in the
band, as far as he could see just then, although
others might be lying down where they were
hidden from observation.</p>

<p>First there was the buck, a big fellow with
a pair of towering antlers that looked particularly
dangerous; then there was a cow; and
finally a half-grown calf.</p>

<p>It was upon this last that Roger had
fastened a covetous eye, for he knew that the
meat of both the older animals would very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
likely prove pretty tough eating, and just then
he was after a supply of food, rather than a
skin from which to make moccasins, or a new
fringed borderman’s jacket.</p>

<p>As his cousin had said, the wind was just
where he most wanted it, blowing directly
from the feeding animals toward the place
where he was edging his way along, foot by
foot, careful not to make the least movement
that the elk might notice and take the
alarm.</p>

<p>Keeping a close watch upon them now,
Roger tried to suit his movements to their
own; that is, he waited until the three had
their heads down while cropping the sweet
grass that grew in the glade. At such a time
he crept a little closer.</p>

<p>These golden opportunities did not come as
frequently as he wished, for it seemed to him
as though the elk had some arrangement
whereby they took turn-about in keeping a suspicious
eye around, one doing this duty while
the other two fed. Still, now and then a chance
came, of which he was always quick to make
use.</p>

<p>Ten, fifteen minutes had passed, and by that
time he felt that he was in a position to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a fair shot if it became necessary to do so in
a hurry. He figured on trying his skill, even
should the elk suddenly take the alarm, and
start to run away. Roger had practised long
and devotedly at moving targets, and delighted
in being able to hit a running animal, just
as an Indian, born to the bow, might have
done.</p>

<p>Still, he felt that he would like to get a little
nearer to the youngster before trying to get
in his work. Fresh meat meant a good deal to
them just then, since it would fill a long-felt
want, and at the same time help to preserve
their priceless ammunition. And under these
conditions the boy was bound to make as sure
of his aim as possible.</p>

<p>With most species of ordinary antelope and
deer the young is called a fawn; but even in
those days, with so large an animal as an elk,
a moose, or a buffalo, it was known as a calf;
and so the boys had learned to term it.</p>

<p>Peering out from behind the clump of
bushes that served him as his last screen,
Roger saw just one more good hiding-place
close at hand, if only the chance arose whereby
he could reach it.</p>

<p>He did not want to lie flat on his face from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
now on, and wriggle along like a crawling
snake; because while in that position he would
not be able to shoot quickly, should the elk take
the alarm.</p>

<p>So he meant to wait again until all three of
the animals seemed to be engaged in feeding,
when he would creep stealthily forward. He
could keep his eye fastened on the elk, and if
one of them started to raise its head Roger
would instantly become as rigid as a stump;
and possibly, if the animal noticed him at all,
it would take his motionless figure for some
such harmless thing.</p>

<p>But fortune was very kind to the young
hunter. He managed to gain the new covert
without having to halt once; which he considered
a lucky thing indeed. And it can be
set down as certain that, having held his
breath pretty much all the time he was making
this critical change of base, Roger heaved a
great sigh of relief when he found he had succeeded
in his undertaking, and that, so far as
he could see, the usually timid elk had not
shown the least sign of alarm.</p>

<p>Now would come the test of skill, when he
was to gradually raise himself until on his
knees, and, taking sure aim, send his keen-pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
arrow straight at the flank of the
youngster, fortunately nearer to him than
either of the others.</p>

<p>Roger tried to still his rapidly beating heart.
Strange how excited he always grew at a time
when he needed all the coolness he could summon.
Had it been Dick, the chances were that
he would be perfectly self-possessed under
similar circumstances, and able to do his level
best; whereas a fellow who finds himself
trembling as with the “buck ague” is placed
under a handicap. And yet Roger had brought
many a fine deer low with his trusty gun,
during all the time that he had ranged the
woods and open country in search of game for
the family at home.</p>

<p>Having in some measure managed to get
control over his nerves, he now prepared to
carry out his plans.</p>

<p>First of all it was necessary that the elk be
feeding at the same moment, and it seemed to
the impatient Roger that one of them was on
the lookout all of the time.</p>

<p>But in the end his chance did come; perhaps
in less time than he imagined, for Roger was
apt to count seconds as minutes when laboring
under such a strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had the big buck lowered his head
than gradually the form of the hunter arose
from the midst of the clump of grass. The
sturdy bow was extended, clutched in a hand
that no longer trembled, but was as firm as a
rock; the other started to draw back the arrow,
the notched end of which was fitted on the
taut cord.</p>

<p>Roger could have asked for no better chance
than the one now presented to him, for by the
greatest of good luck the side of the calf was
toward him, and its left foreleg advanced,
giving him a splendid opening to speed his arrow
straight at a vital point behind that same
shoulder.</p>

<p>So Roger let fly. The hurtling shaft shot
through the sunlight like a thing of life, the
eagle feathers with which it was plumed simply
showing to a practised eye the direction in
which it sped.</p>

<p>There was heard a slight thud as the arrow
struck. The calf was seen to start violently,
while both the buck and the doe looked up, and
jumped several feet.</p>

<p>Then all three started to run off, though it
was instantly seen by the young hunter that
the calf faltered, and grew weak from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
effect of the death-dealing barb that had
pierced its side.</p>

<p>Roger had instinctively thrown up his hand
and drawn another arrow from his quiver,
which he was even then adjusting to his bowstring.
He had several reasons for doing this.
In the first place his hunter instinct advised
him that it was always best to be on the safe
side; for there could be no telling but what
that savage old buck would get over his fright,
and turn to offer battle to the enemy. And in
that open place, with not even a friendly tree
to offer him refuge from those ugly antlers,
Roger had no heart for the job of meeting an
enraged beast, capable of doing him serious
damage before Dick could come to the rescue
with his rifle.</p>

<p>But the young elk had evidently received a
fatal wound, for it ran only a dozen yards,
when it began to stagger.</p>

<p>Just then, as Roger, having fitted his second
arrow, was in the act of taking a swift aim, so
as to be ready to make assurance doubly certain,
to his astonishment he heard a peculiar
twang that sounded like the snap of a bowstring.</p>

<p>And, as he arose to his feet to start forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
after the wounded animal, just falling to the
ground, he believed that he saw a second arrow
sticking from its side.</p>

<p>The first instinct of the hunter is to make
sure of his quarry; and so Roger hastened to
run forward. He kept a wary eye on the other
elk, however, to see that the possessor of those
tremendous antlers did not turn back, with the
idea of giving battle to the strange enemy on
two legs, so different from the four-footed
wolves and panthers which he had known in
the past.</p>

<p>But somehow this did not come to pass.
Either the buck failed to grasp the full nature
of the disaster that had befallen his little family;
or else, catching a whiff of human foes
about that time, fear had dominated valor. At
any rate he sped out of sight, with the frightened
doe ahead of him—at least the buck was
gallant enough to hang back, and protect the
rear.</p>

<p>Roger went as fast as he could toward the
fallen calf, pleased to know that he had been
so successful in his little hunt, and that they
would have fresh meat for some time to come.</p>

<p>As he ran he seemed to understand, as
though through instinct, that there was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
one else pushing ahead on one side of him;
but, being in such desperate haste to plant a
foot on the fallen game first, he could not even
take the time to look.</p>

<p>He heard a distant whoop from Dick, which,
however, fell on deaf ears if it was intended
as a warning. Roger was an obstinate boy,
and, having taken a notion to accomplish a
certain thing, he could not be easily discouraged
or influenced to give up his design.</p>

<p>There the young elk lay, and in plain sight,
so that, rushing up, Roger had no difficulty in
placing his right foot on the still quivering
body, by that act making it known to whoever
disputed his claim that he intended to stand by
his rights.</p>

<p>It happened that the animal had fallen so
that its wounded side lay uppermost, and one
of the first things the young hunter noticed
was the fact that there were <i>two</i> arrows deeply
imbedded there; his own well-known eagle-feathered
shaft, and one that had the token of
the gray goose fastened to its end in a peculiar
circling manner, calculated to influence its
steadiness of flight.</p>

<p>Then, casting his eyes up, Roger saw the
figure of his rival—apparently an Indian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
though dressed in tanned buckskin after the
manner of white hunters, and gripping a bow
in his left hand.</p>

<p>The other was staring hard at the boy, as
though astounded to find himself face to face
with a young paleface, never before known in
this particular section.</p>

<p>And there they stood, each with a foot advanced,
and a look of defiance on their faces,
as though ready to dispute title to the possession
of the dead elk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>“ALL, OR NONE!”</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Game</span> mine!”</p>

<p>When the dark-faced man in the fringed
buckskin said these two words in an angry
tone, Roger felt something of a shock. He
looked closer, and realized that possibly the
other hunter might <i>not</i> be an Indian after all,
but one of those half-breeds who sometimes
made their homes with the tribes, and again
sought the company of the whites, either English
or French.</p>

<p>“Oh! is that so?” the boy answered back,
in a satirical tone; “well, just prove it to me
then, and I’ll throw up my claim.”</p>

<p>He kept his arrow fitted to the bowstring all
the time, and aimed directly toward the breast
of the other. Should the necessity have arisen
he could have sped the shaft like lightning,
even at such close range, for it only requires
one quick movement of the arm to do this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The man pointed to the arrow that was just
back of the fallen elk’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Put there—in heart—bring game down
every time!” he ejaculated, with the most refreshing
impudence imaginable, that made the
boy looked amazed, then furious, and finally
laugh outright.</p>

<p>“Oh! is that your dodge, then?” he exclaimed.
“You claim that as your arrow, do
you? Well, suppose you show me another just
like it. Every one of mine is tipped with eagle
feathers, and made by the son of a chief; while
yours are lined with the quills of a wild gray
goose. That ought to be proof enough to settle
the matter.”</p>

<p>“My elk!” growled the other, with a glitter
in his black eyes that boded ill for the boy,
should he be caught off his guard.</p>

<p>But Roger knew well that his cousin must by
now have unhitched both horses, and be hurrying
up, intent on taking a hand in the affair, if
necessary. Besides, he was in the habit of
looking out for himself in such matters.</p>

<p>There is probably nothing that ever angered
a borderer, young or old, more, than to
have his right and title to certain game he
had shot disputed by a rival claimant, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the evidence was all in favor of the first
hunter.</p>

<p>Many a fatal quarrel has been recorded in
the history of the frontier through this very
same thing, where two men have crept up on
their quarry, unknown to each other, and fired
at about the same time. Each always rested
under the belief that his missile was the one
that brought the game down; or, even if this
were not so, that he could have sent in a second
shot which would have accomplished the end
he had in view.</p>

<p>But Roger was a fair and square sort of lad,
also generous in the extreme.</p>

<p>He could realize how keenly disappointed
any one must be at finding another just ahead
when the final test came. It was his design to
prove his claim to the young elk, so that none
could dispute it; and then offer to divide.</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” he said, trying to speak impressively.
“We may have crept up on the
game at the same time; but I chanced to shoot
first. My arrow struck there, and entered the
animal’s heart. That was a fatal wound. The
beast had almost come to a full stop, and was
staggering, ready to drop, when I heard your
bowstring twang. Besides, your arrow entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the body; and, as it was, without any
other hurt, the elk would have run far before
dropping. You know that as well as I do.
And so it is my game.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! better not try keep elk!” grunted
the other, while his fingers were seen to
twitch as he gripped his bow; but he had
not taken time to fit another arrow after letting
loose, and so the white boy had a decided
advantage over him, which those restless black
eyes had not failed to note.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll tell you what I’d be willing to
do, because I know how hard it is to go through
all that work of creeping up, and then lose the
game. I’ve proved that my arrow killed the
elk; but I’m willing to go halves with you!
How does that suit?”</p>

<p>When Roger said this he knew Dick was
coming, and that, as he undoubtedly would be
holding his rifle ready in his hands, he could
make quick use of it should the necessity arise.
So that it was certainly not fear that induced
him to offer to hand over half of the game to
the rival claimant.</p>

<p>But apparently the dark-faced man was not
the kind to appreciate such generosity. With
him it was a matter of all, or none. He knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
well that by rights he had no sort of claim to
the game, but hoped to bully the boy into
abandoning his just claims.</p>

<p>“My game!” he replied doggedly; “see
first, and shoot before same fall. What business
you have here in hunting land of Shoshones?
If I tell chief, Running Antelope, he
soon find, and have scalp hanging in wigwam!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess not,” remarked Roger, thinking
that it might be best to let this other, who
must be friendly with the hostile Indians, believe
that he and Dick were only the forerunners
of a large party; “for my friends
would come up in numbers, and burn the village
of Running Antelope, if he so much as injured
a hair on my head. But here is my
hunter companion; let us see what he says.”</p>

<p>When the half-breed turned his head, and
saw what a well-armed fellow Dick was, as well
as noted the look on his face, he drew back a
step, as though realizing that his absurd claim
on the quarry would never have a ghost of a
show at making good. If one white boy could
not be browbeaten, there was little chance that
he could bully a pair of them.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about, Roger?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Dick, as he jumped from his horse, rifle in
hand, and pressed the weapon of his cousin
into the other’s willing hands; for, after all,
a gun felt much better than a bow, when there
was need for action.</p>

<p>“Settle this matter, Dick,” observed the
young hunter, eagerly. “I shot first, and you
can see my arrow sticking just back of the
shoulder. It must have reached a vital place,
for the beast was just staggering, ready to fall,
when I heard his bowstring sound—and you
can see where he struck. That elk would have
run one or two miles with a hurt through the
body like this; because we have seen deer do
the same. Am I right, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Every word of it is the truth, Roger,” replied
the other, quietly, but at the same time
positively.</p>

<p>“And,” Roger went on, “you can see
whose arrow it is that did the business, Dick;
because mine are feathered with eagle plumes,
while his all have the gray goose quills
fastened on the shaft, circling it so as to give
the arrow a whirling motion as it passes
through the air.”</p>

<p>“The proof is everything that any honest
man would ask to back up your claim,” Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
continued; “but what were you offering to do
when I came up? I heard him say that it was
his game, and saw him shake his head as if he
refused an offer.”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t want to be stingy about it,
and offered to share and share alike with
him,” replied Roger. “That was fair enough,
since the whole of the game belongs to me by
the law of the woods.”</p>

<p>“I should say it was,” his cousin exclaimed,
turning again to the half-breed, who stood
there, moodily listening to this talk, and shooting
black looks at the pair of white boys.</p>

<p>“And then he started to threaten me, saying
that if he carried the news of our being
here in the land of the fierce Shoshones to
their big chief, Running Antelope, he would
come with his braves, and make us prisoners,
so that our hair would hang in the lodges of
the Indians. That’s a nice way to answer a
fellow, Dick, when he makes an offer like that.
It was just like a slap in the face.”</p>

<p>“Just so, Roger; and for one I think you
ought to take it back, after the way he answered
you,” Dick went on, frowning at the
dark-faced man. “He says all or none, does
he? Very good, let it be none, then. We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
use this young elk nicely, and you earned the
prize. I never saw a better stalk in my life.”</p>

<p>“And,” remarked Roger, still meaning to
impress the half-breed with the idea that they
were only the skirmishers of a large party of
whites that was advancing up the Missouri,
“some of the rest of our friends would be glad
of a chance to put their teeth into such tender
juicy meat as this, eh, Dick?”</p>

<p>Of course Dick guessed instantly what object
his cousin had in making such a queer remark,
but he was too wise to say anything to
the contrary. In fact he thought so well of the
little scheme himself that he smiled, and
nodded his head as he remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, I should think they would, Roger;
anybody’d like a meal of such tender meat.
And now, who may you be? I don’t suppose
your name is Lascelles, is it?” and he turned
upon the half-breed as he asked this sudden
question.</p>

<p>A flash of intelligence, when that name was
mentioned, passed over the dark face of the
other; but he shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>“Not Lascelles. Know same though.
Name Batiste Dupuy. Trapper, trader, voyageur
from the North. Friend of Running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Antelope, and the Cheyennes. They give
right to hunt, trap all through this country.
Paleface boys no business shoot elk. My
game! Must have all or none. Ugh!”</p>

<p>If his name was Batiste Dupuy, as he
claimed, the half-breed must have lived a good
part of his life among the redmen, for he had
copied many of their ways. His knowledge of
English seemed rather meagre, for he could
hardly find suitable means whereby to express
himself; for, while he spoke, he made many
violent gestures, that were intended to add
vigor to his few words.</p>

<p>“Then make up your mind you’re going to
have none,” said Roger, now growing angry
himself at the arrogance of the fellow. “If
you want your arrow, here it is; but not an
ounce of the elk meat do you get.”</p>

<p>He jerked the shaft feathered with the quills
of the gray goose from its lodging-place in the
side of the dead elk, and handed it out toward
the other. The man condescended to take it,
but immediately broke it across his knee, as
though by such violent means he expected them
to understand that he intended to be their inveterate
foe from that time forth.</p>

<p>“Go! Get out of this!” cried the impetuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Roger, pointing with his quivering finger.
“And just remember, Monsieur Dupuy, we
have long rifles here, and know how to drive a
nail at thirty paces; so that, if you try to do
us any harm, it will be at your peril. That is
all.”</p>

<p>An Indian might have said, “I have
spoken!” but Roger’s way was just as expressive,
accompanied as it was by that sweep
of the hand.</p>

<p>The man’s eyes narrowed until they seemed
to be mere slits, as he glared at the bold young
speaker. Then he flung his head in a disdainful
gesture, and remarked with a sneer:</p>

<p>“Never before did Batiste Dupuy take orders
from a cub. Huh! wait and see who
laughs loudest. Mebbe Batiste, his hour will
come soon. Lascelles, you said?—it may be
I know same; and he much glad to hear of
you! Sacre! that is all I say!”</p>

<p>With that he made them a mocking bow,
showing that he surely had French blood in
his veins, and, whirling on his moccasined
heel, strode angrily away.</p>

<p>After going a certain distance he turned and
looked toward them, as if measuring the intervening
space. Roger even thought he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
see him fitting an arrow to his bowstring and
at once half raised his rifle threateningly. If
Batiste had intended trying a shot at them, he
speedily abandoned his idea when he saw how
ready they were to send their lead in his direction.
He must have known that pioneer
boys were quite at home with their long-barreled
guns, and could snip off the swaying
head of a wild turkey, buried in the earth to
its neck, at the annual shoots where the best
marksmen came together to compete.</p>

<p>At any rate, he contented himself with
shaking his fist in their direction, and then
moving away again.</p>

<p>“A good riddance to bad rubbish!” exclaimed
Roger, though evidently pleased to see
the last of the ruffian.</p>

<p>“And we’d better be getting away from
here as soon as we can,” remarked Dick, better
able than his impulsive companion to understand
what this chance encounter, and the
making of an enemy, might mean for them.</p>

<p>“But he knows that François Lascelles,
Dick; you heard him say so!” Roger remarked,
as he started to fasten his horse, so
that they could cut up the game as speedily as
possible, and ride away, one of them meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
standing guard, so that the half-breed
might not sneak up close enough to use his bow
on them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guessed that he might, for they belong
to the same class,” the other observed,
thoughtfully. “Perhaps Lascelles has bought
pelts from this rover, and they may be the best
of friends. And, if he knows that the French
trader is anywhere around here now, be sure
he will try to get word to him as fast as he
can, to tell about our coming. And from now
on we will have to be on our guard every
minute of the day and night, looking for an
attack from either the Indians, or the party of
the Frenchman. They did not seem to know
just how many started out with Lascelles and
his son, but it must have been several.”</p>

<p>“And of the same stripe as himself,” remarked
Roger, starting to take the skin from
the young elk with a skill that had been attained
only through long practice. “Remember
what our fathers said, Dick; day and
night we must keep watch for the silent foe
that would crawl up on us unseen, and catch
us napping!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE HIDDEN CAMP</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> remained only an hour or so of daylight
after Roger had secured the best parts
of the carcass of the young elk, and fastened
the bundle of fresh meat to his saddle.</p>

<p>Dick knew that they must be more than ordinarily
careful where they spent the night,
because the chances were the vindictive half-breed
would be scouring the country looking
for signs of them. If they were incautious
about building the cooking fire, his sharp eyes
would be sure to discover their location; and,
should that occur, they could expect trouble.</p>

<p>The thing that worried them most of all was
the possible theft of their mounts. That the
packhorse had been stolen was not a matter
of such importance, for they could get on without
an additional animal; but in regard to their
saddle horses the case was vastly different.</p>

<p>It would be next to impossible to overtake
the expedition on foot, as they had learned before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
now. In following the river, there were
times when, on account of bad ground, they had
to cover five miles in order to make one of
progress. And all this time the hardy voyageurs
who were boatmen for Captain Lewis
would be urging their craft forward with the
skill and ability peculiar to their kind.</p>

<p>This being the case, Dick was bent on finding
some hiding-place for a camp, where they
could be additionally secure, and the horses
kept within close reach.</p>

<p>“No fire to-night, unless we can hide it,” he
announced to his companion, when they were
once more moving along, keeping a constant
lookout for foes, and at the same time on the
alert for the nook that would meet their requirements
for a camp.</p>

<p>Roger groaned.</p>

<p>“Then I do hope we’ll be lucky enough to
find a good place,” he remarked, as he redoubled
his efforts to make the discovery;
“because I’m hungry for a bite of this fine
young elk. Why, it’s been three days now, or
even more, since I put a tooth in fresh meat.
This tough old pemmican is as hard as flint,
and next to tasteless.”</p>

<p>“But you know what our mother would say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Roger about looking a gift horse in the mouth.
If we could get nothing better, this same
dried venison would keep us alive; and when
you’re real hungry it doesn’t seem so very
bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, perhaps not, Dick,” admitted
the other; “and I’ve seen times when it tasted
pretty good; but after being on that pemmican
for three days, and with a young elk in hand,
it would be hard if we couldn’t have a fire to-night.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope that the chance turns up,
then,” remarked Dick, cheerfully. “And
about this same pemmican, you know that the
Indians live pretty much all winter on it. Besides,
when a brave is sent a hundred or two
miles across country, to carry a message to the
chief of another tribe, all he takes along with
him is a little dried meat in his ditty bag, that
he munches once in a while, drinking at the
springs he runs across on the way. I believe
an Indian runner could keep on from the Mississippi
to the ocean just that way, carrying
all he needed to eat in a package not larger
than my head.”</p>

<p>They kept pushing on, making as good time
as the nature of the rough ground permitted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
while the sun dropped out of sight, and dusk
began to gather around them.</p>

<p>Roger was really beginning to despair, and
feared that they would have to pass a fireless
night, one keeping constantly on guard while
the other slept, so that the horses might be
protected, when a sudden low exclamation
from his companion thrilled him.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dick?” he asked, nervously
fingering his gun, which he kept in his hand as
he rode along; “did you see any one skulking
in the shadows?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, not that, Roger,” replied his
cousin, cheerfully; “but, unless I miss my
guess, we’ve come to a fine place to make our
camp; and, if things turn out as well as I expect,
there ought to be a chance for a small
fire, enough of a blaze to cook some of your
meat by.”</p>

<p>“Good! You make me feel happy again,
Dick!” exclaimed the other, eagerly; “but
show me where you’ve made this discovery.”</p>

<p>“Look over in that direction, and you can
see the rocks piled up,” Dick went on. “It
seems to me that we ought to find a hiding-place
among them, where we can pitch our
little camp. Of course it means that we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
come down, and pull all the grass the horses
will need, and perhaps take them to water, too;
but that is nothing to worry over, if only we
pass the night without an attack.”</p>

<p>It turned out as Dick predicted, for they did
find a splendid nook in the midst of the rocks,
where they could be safe from observation.
And Roger soon discovered the very spot for
the little fire.</p>

<p>Both the young pioneers were soon as busy
as beavers, for there was much to be done.
The horses had been watered before coming up
among the rocks, so that would not have to be
attended to again. Dick went down, and
started to pull grass, which he carried in armfuls
up to where the horses had been secured;
and once the faithful beasts started to contentedly
munch at their supper, there was no
reason why they should give any more trouble.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roger had started the fire. It
was only an apology for one, and offered little
cheer; but on this occasion the boys were not
thinking of sitting around a blaze, toasting
their feet, and watching the sparks fly upward,
to “tell all creation of their presence,” as
Roger expressed it. All they wanted was sufficient
heat to cook the meat and make a pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of tea, after which the fire would be allowed
to go out.</p>

<p>Roger knew how to cook better than most
lads of his age, and Dick always let him have
full swing when out on their numerous hunting
trips. Considering the few appliances for
comfort which hunters in those days carried
with them, the boys got on splendidly. If there
was no frying-pan handy they could thrust
small portions of meat on the ends of long
splinters of wood, and in this fashion manage
to obtain what was to them a satisfying
meal.</p>

<p>The tender elk meat pleased them both, and
Roger was kept busy with “repeat orders”
for some time. But finally they cared for no
more; after which the red embers of the cooking
fire were covered with earth, and the last
sign of human presence obliterated, even the
odor of supper passing away with the disappearance
of the heat.</p>

<p>Later on, Roger lay down in his blanket and
slept soundly, while Dick sat, gun in hand, and
watched. Long did the hours seem, and many
times no doubt some cry from a night bird
would startle the sentry, always suspicious lest
this might be a signal uttered by some creeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Indian to tell his mates that he had made a
discovery.</p>

<p>When the stars had given notice that the
time for his vigil was at an end, Dick woke the
other, and from that hour on to daybreak
Roger sat silent, watchful, and faithful.</p>

<p>But there was no alarm, and with the coming
of dawn they shook hands over the fact that
they had managed to elude the search which
Dupuy had made for their camp, during much
of the night.</p>

<p>Again was a fire started, with the aid of the
ever handy flint and steel. Had the boys had
the misfortune to lose these almost indispensable
articles, Roger knew how to create a tiny
blaze with the aid of a small bow and a twirling
stick. This trick he had been taught by
an old traveler, who declared he had seen the
natives do the same far away on islands in
the East Indies. But, although Roger could
accomplish the feat, it was always a difficult
thing to do, and he much preferred the ordinary
method of making fire from sparks
made by striking flint against steel.</p>

<p>Finally, having loaded the horses again, and
in a better fashion than before, the boys were
ready to make a fresh start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger wondered whether they would chance
to run across the half-breed anywhere.</p>

<p>“He looked so angry,” he said, as they
started away from the rocky fortress that had
made them such a capital camp, “that I believe
he would think nothing of sending one of
his arrows into my back as I passed some
secret hiding-place; or use his rifle, if he had
one somewhere at the time he started to creep
up on the elk, the same way I did, wishing to
save his ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Then let us hope we will see nothing of
him,” observed Dick; but all the same he was
a little nervous as they rode on.</p>

<p>And, after all, Roger’s fears were not without
foundation, for a short time later, as they
were cantering along, they heard the twang of
a bowstring. Both boys involuntarily ducked.
They never knew just how close the arrow
came, but both heard the hiss as it passed, and
then a thud as it struck a tree.</p>

<p>“Run for it!” exclaimed Dick, as he dug
his heels into the sides of his horse, and, bending
low in the saddle, went flying forward at
an almost reckless pace.</p>

<p>Roger followed close behind, grumbling as
he rode; but there were no more arrows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in a short time they were able to sit upright
again, although Dick continued to urge his
animal to make more speed.</p>

<p>“That was too bad, Dick,” complained
Roger; “it makes my blood boil to think of the
two of us running away from only one. We
could have turned, and placed him between
two fires, so that it would soon seem pretty hot
for the coward. Why did you run away?”</p>

<p>“There were a good many reasons, Roger,”
answered the other, who was quite used to
these exhibitions of recklessness on the part
of his cousin, and always made it a point to
explain the motives that actuated his conduct,
so that the other might profit by his caution.
“First of all, we could not tell how many
enemies there were around us. If we had
waited, we might have been surrounded by a
dozen Shoshones or Cheyennes, and either
killed or taken prisoners. And then again,
Roger, I never want to forget that we are the
messengers of our fathers, sent on a most important
mission. If we choose to take unnecessary
risks, and that paper never comes back
signed by Jasper Williams, think of the consequences
that are apt to follow. So you see that
it is a wise thing for us to take no chances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
We promised our mothers that, Roger; don’t
forget again, when tempted to risk everything
to please your own feelings.”</p>

<p>“Dick, you’re right, just as you always are,
and I’m sorry I spoke that way. Yes, it would
have been foolish to turn and try to punish
that skulking half-breed. And he did no damage
after all with his spinning arrow. Did
you hear what a whistling noise it made as it
passed over?”</p>

<p>“That was caused by the feathers being
placed in a sort of winding way, so as to make
the arrow whirl as it flew,” Dick explained.
“It made me think of the duck we call a
whistler, whose wings make a sound as it flies
such as you can make by blowing in a hollow
reed. But we seem to have outdistanced the
enemy now, and perhaps it would be safe to
breathe the horses a little.”</p>

<p>They pushed on during the whole of that
day without once meeting any difficulty; although
there were times when they found
themselves compelled to make wide detours in
order to avoid bad stretches of ground, or
sloughs, where the footing was treacherous for
the horses. (<a id="Note_3r"></a><a href="#Note_3">Note 3</a>.)</p>

<p>On this account they did not make the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
impetuous Roger would have wished for,
although his companion declared himself satisfied.</p>

<p>“Better luck, perhaps, to-morrow,” he
would say, whenever Roger complained; and
thus the latter was shamed out of his mood.</p>

<p>That night they found a place to camp that
was totally unlike the fortress amidst the
rocks, but offered them just as secure a
refuge. And again they saw daylight come
without any alarm.</p>

<p>So three days passed away, and it was now
to be hoped that they would see nothing more
of the half-breed. Dick remained on his guard,
all the same, for he did not mean to be caught
napping.</p>

<p>The nature of the country had changed
again, and, instead of the woods or rocky
bluffs which they had left farther down the
river, they now found themselves looking out
on vast stretches of level prairie, where the
tall grass waved in the breeze until it resembled
the waters of a wide sea; and in places
innumerable wild flowers dotted it like
splashes of paint, making a picture that even
boys could admire.</p>

<p>Here they would be apt to come upon many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
novel things, of which they may have heard
wandering trappers speak, but which up to
recently they had hardly expected to see for
themselves.</p>

<p>At the same time there would be ever-increasing
danger of their being discovered by
some hand of red hunters, stalking antelope or
bison, and ready to leave their hunting for a
more convenient season if they saw a chance
to capture palefaces, with their wonderful
“shooting-sticks,” which in those days were
a source of great bewilderment to the Indians
west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, in spite of the constant
presence of peril, the two lads enjoyed the experience,
and had no regrets about having
started on the adventurous mission, since they
were at the same time serving those they loved
so well, and satisfying the craving for excitement
that seems to be a part of almost every
boy’s nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>ON THE BILLOWY PRAIRIE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> this day there was hardly a stretch
of half an hour but Dick and Roger made some
new and interesting discovery. Now it was a
little herd of antelope that, scenting the presence
of human enemies on the wind, sprang
from the grass where they had been lying, and
went off with graceful bounds that awoke the
ardent admiration of Dick, while Roger aimed
his gun after them, though he was not foolish
enough to waste precious ammunition when his
good sense told him he had not a ghost of a
show to bring the game down.</p>

<p>A little later they stumbled upon a village
of prairie dogs, the first either of the boys had
ever set eyes on. In fact, the first sign they
had of the settlement was when one of the
horses broke through into a burrow, and came
near throwing its rider, or breaking a leg.</p>

<p>Then there was a great clatter as scores of
the queer little fellows started to bark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
then vanish inside their burrows, from which
they later cautiously thrust their noses, curious
to see what these strange intruders were
like.</p>

<p>“Better slow down to a walk until we are
clear of this place,” warned Dick, as he suited
his action to his words. “Did you ever see
such a sight, Roger? There must be thousands
of these little chaps around here; and hear the
fierce way they bark at us before they run indoors.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they are good to eat?” asked
the practical Roger, for the elk meat was all
gone, and he had begun to wonder what they
might find next.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” his cousin replied;
“and I wouldn’t like to try before I
saw some one else eat one. The Indians are
very fond of baked dog, you know; but I never
heard that it was this breed. Better give that
idea up, Roger; a little later we may find a
chance to knock over one of those fast-running
antelope, or else get a young buffalo calf for a
change.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good enough for me,” remarked
the other; “and so I think I’ll let the
prairie dogs alone just now. But look there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
isn’t that a rattlesnake lying in the sun outside
that burrow?”</p>

<p>“Just what it is,” Dick answered, quickly.
“Which reminds me that I’ve been told
that the snakes seem to occupy the burrows
along with the dogs. Perhaps they’ve got
some sort of arrangement between them;
or else the prairie dog isn’t afraid of the
poison of the rattlesnake. See, there’s another,
yes, and even a third one, much larger
than any of the rest!”</p>

<p>“Ugh! wouldn’t I hate to have to walk
through this village in the dark!” Roger exclaimed,
with a shudder, as they passed several
more snakes lying in the warm sunshine,
not at all bothered by the thud of horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad job going through it, even on
horseback, and in the daytime,” Dick observed,
“because you have to watch closely to keep
from having the animal break through the roof
of a burrow; and, first thing you know, one of
those nasty rattlesnakes might be striking at
the horse’s legs. It would be a shame to lose
so valuable an animal in that way, when we
need them both so badly.”</p>

<p>That caused Roger to awaken to the fact
that he was not paying as much attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
his progress through the populous town as he
should; and, having had his fears aroused, he
now began to keep a close watch for signs of
trouble ahead.</p>

<p>Being thus fully on their guard they were
able to reach the border of the prairie dog settlement
without having met with any disaster;
and, the last they saw of it, several of the boldest
of the natives had crept out of their burrows,
and seemed to be “barking them a farewell,”
as Roger laughingly said.</p>

<p>While they were jealous concerning their
ammunition, hoarding it against a possible
emergency, they seldom lost an opportunity
to wet a line in the great river, whenever their
camp was close by the bank.</p>

<p>Roger always carried hooks and lines along
with him, so that on the present occasion he
was well equipped to capture all the finny
prizes they needed for food.</p>

<p>Many a night, while Dick slept, the other
would sit on the river bank, with his line in
his hand, waiting for a bite, and seldom did his
vigilance go unrewarded, so that they had fish
for breakfast on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>It happened that once again they discovered
a place where undoubtedly the expedition they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were following must have waited over night.
There were the plain tracks of horses’ hoofs,
and also the ashes of several fires, for, being
in such numbers, the explorers of the Missouri
did not feel compelled to hide whenever they
made camp, in order to keep their location a
secret from spying eyes.</p>

<p>Of course Roger asked his companion to try
to find out from various signs, which could be
readily picked up, whether they were now any
closer to the column than on that other occasion,
when they rested in the abandoned camp
of the explorers.</p>

<p>This Dick did in a most thorough fashion,
and, after concluding his labors, he announced
it as his belief that they had indeed gained another
day.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” remarked Roger, evidently
disappointed; and from his manner one might
believe he had expected to hear Dick say they
would overtake Captain Lewis by another day
or so.</p>

<p>“On my part,” declared Dick, “I think
that we are doing as well as we ought to expect.
All I ask is that things go right along
as they have been doing. We are seeing some
wonderful sights while we keep on the move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
each day. And, besides, you forget, Roger,
that the sooner we come up with the expedition,
the sooner we must be taking the back
trail. Now that we’re away out here in this
strange country I’d like to see all I can of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” Roger replied, nodding
his head to show that he quite agreed with his
cousin; “and, do you know, Dick, if only we
could find some safe way to get that paper
home, after it has been signed by Jasper
Williams, I’d like nothing better than to keep
right on with Captain Lewis, and go with him
all the way to the ocean. Oh! what a glorious
thing that would be; and what strange sights
we would see when we got to the mountains
we’ve heard so much about, that they say
reach far up into the clouds, and abound in all
sorts of game, such as can be found nowhere
else.”</p>

<p>Dick himself heaved a sigh, on hearing his
companion speak in that way.</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be almost too good for us
to enjoy, Roger,” he said, “much as we might
wish it to come true. Our first duty is to make
sure that the paper gets to our grandfather,
since so much depends on it. I wouldn’t take
any chance about its safe delivery, because we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
would never forgive ourselves if it went
astray.”</p>

<p>“But, Dick, if we found that Captain Lewis
meant to dispatch some of his men over the
back trail, with an important message of his
own, telling President Jefferson what success
he had met with so far, couldn’t we trust the
paper in their charge?”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t discuss that unless the opportunity
comes,” the other remarked; for, to
tell the truth, the temptation was almost irresistible,
even to steady, reliable Dick Armstrong.
Both boys possessed a strong yearning
for exploration, and during their various
hunts they had sought out new fields in every
direction, whenever it was at all possible.</p>

<p>Another temptation had come to Roger with
almost every hour of the day. This was the
presence of innumerable prairie hens that
were flying up from the long grass in every
direction, as the horses passed along.</p>

<p>Roger kept his bow and arrows handy, and
was frequently tempted to make use of them
in trying for some of these plump and edible
fowl, which often presented what looked like
easy shots; but Dick was for hurrying, and
did not wish to delay, at any time, long enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
for his companion to creep up on the
“chickens.”</p>

<p>But when they rested at noon, or in the early
evening stopped to make camp, Roger would
be denied his pleasure no longer, but started
to stalk some of the ever present birds.</p>

<p>Nor was success wanting, for he succeeded
in sending his feathered shafts through a brace
of plump hens, which they managed to cook
over a fire that was built in a hole dug in the
ground, so that the flame might not be seen afar
and draw the attention they sought to avoid.</p>

<p>Another day saw them crossing a wide
stretch of the prairie, to avoid a slough that
seemed to extend for many miles along the
border of the river.</p>

<p>It had been a rather warm day, and several
times they had eyed the heavens, as if half
expecting that the clouds would gather and
send down a deluge of rain. Up to now they
had been singularly fortunate in having escaped
many storms, and it chanced that those
that did come had found the young explorers
in some snug shelter. To be caught out on the
open might not turn out to be such a pleasant
thing for them.</p>

<p>Although they had now been on the march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
for weeks, neither of the boys seemed to feel
in any way anxious for their journey to end,
save that Roger’s impatience occasionally
leaped beyond bounds; for he kept wondering
whether they would find Jasper Williams after
all, and their mission prove a success.</p>

<p>There were so many new sights to look upon
as they went on, that it seemed as though
they were continually expecting novel things.
Around the settlement it had been pretty
much all woods, so that this wonderful prairie
was a source of never-ending delight to both
lads, filling them with something of the same
awe that one who is accustomed to the interior
feels when first he sets eyes on the great ocean.</p>

<p>“I hope, though, we can make the river by
to-morrow,” Roger was saying when the sun
seemed to be well down in the sky, and it
looked certain that they were to make camp
again in the open.</p>

<p>“Chances are that it lies away over yonder,
where you can just see a fringe of something
that must be trees,” Dick observed, pointing
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“And miles away at that, so there’s no use
in trying for it to-day,” Roger said.</p>

<p>He was feeling a little provoked, for, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
begging his companion to hold up half an hour
for him, when he thought he saw a chance to
stalk a small band of antelopes that afternoon,
Roger had spent considerable time and energy
in creeping through the grass, and getting behind
a <i>motte</i> of timber that grew around some
little slough, only to see the timid animals flying
away when he thought he must be close
enough to use his bow.</p>

<p>He had taken revenge, however, in shooting
several prairie chickens, although, having once
“made up his mouth” for venison, this was a
poor substitute, good eating though the birds
had proved on the other occasion.</p>

<p>“It lies to the west of us,” Dick chanced to
say, as they looked toward the low fringe along
the horizon which, as he had said, must be
trees, and evidently bordering the river.</p>

<p>Later, Dick had occasion to congratulate
himself that he had taken notice of the exact
quarter where those trees seemed to lie, as he
saw them just before sunset.</p>

<p>Once again they dug a hole, in which Roger
expected to cook the prairie fowl which had
fallen to his skill as an archer. Dick saw to
the staking of the two horses, and made them
additionally secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The clouds still hung overhead, and it would
be strange if the night passed, he believed,
without some sort of storm breaking over the
prairie. The boys began to wish that they had
their Indian tent along, for, old though it was,
in a heavy downpour not a drop of water
penetrated it.</p>

<p>Dick made preparations looking to a change
of base if the threatening storm proved severe.
He insisted that the bundles be kept almost
intact, so that they could be fastened on the
backs of the horses without the customary
delay. That proved to be another fortunate
move on the part of the boy, and for which he
had much cause to be thankful.</p>

<p>The supper was finally prepared, though the
fire had to be made as before from dead grass
and dry buffalo chips, and was anything but
a joy to Roger, accustomed as he had always
been to plenty of good fuel.</p>

<p>Though they might have had the benefit of
a fair moon but for the clouds, the latter were
so dense that the night seemed inky dark.
The usual noises of crickets and katydids and
other insects appeared to be hushed, so that a
strange silence rested on the wide expanse
around them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>They were tired, and lay down soon after
eating, not knowing how long they would have
a chance to sleep before the coming of the
storm disturbed them again. Dick, in fact,
hardly expected to even doze, for he felt that
some sort of watch should be kept; but, after
lying there a while, his eyes gradually closed,
and almost before he was aware of what was
coming he went to sleep.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys ever knew how much
time passed in this way when they were
aroused by the growling of thunder, as they
believed; and, sitting up, Dick called out to
his companion:</p>

<p>“It’s coming at last, Roger!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard it; but what are we going to
do?” answered the other, fretfully; for the
prospect of getting a wet jacket was not very
inviting.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to stand it, I guess; grin and
bear it, as father says,” Dick returned, being
much more philosophical than Roger.</p>

<p>“But some of our bundles will be soaked,”
declared Roger.</p>

<p>“We can’t help that; and I’ve made sure
to wrap our extra ammunition in the waterproof
cloth, so as to save it. Both of us have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
our horns filled with powder, which will be
sure to keep dry, no matter how we are
drenched. I think I could jump into the river,
and stay there an hour, without a drop getting
into that good old horn father gave me long
ago, and which he used himself when a boy.”</p>

<p>In this fashion did Dick seek to buoy up the
low spirits of his companion.</p>

<p>“It’s getting closer, Dick, and that thunder
is rattling pretty steady, seems to me. I’m
sorry for both of us, because we’re due for a
fine ducking. I hope the horses don’t get
frightened, if the storm is a bad one, and
break their ropes. Hadn’t we better bring
them in close by, Dick? Looks like we’ve got
to worry over our mounts, one way or another,
right along. First it’s Indians stealing them;
then the chance of some panther jumping the
beasts for a meal; and now a stampede, if the
lightning flashes too brightly, or the thunder
breaks over us with a roar. How about it,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea to get them in
here, and keep hold of the ropes,” the other
replied; “horses are always more contented
if they find themselves near human beings in
a storm, so I’ve heard. So come on, then!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>They were now on their feet. The blackness
of the night still held good, only every little
while a flash of lightning along the horizon
whence the storm was coming dispelled it for a
brief interval, when they could see a long distance
away.</p>

<p>Just as they started to get the horses Dick
noticed that the distant rumbling sound had
grown heavier. Suddenly he stood still, and
clutched the sleeve of his companion’s tunic.</p>

<p>“Roger, perhaps that isn’t thunder we hear,
after all!” he exclaimed, with a catch in his
voice, as though the presence of some new and
never before experienced danger influenced
him.</p>

<p>“Why, what could it be then?” demanded
the other, instantly.</p>

<p>“Oh! look! look yonder!” cried Dick.</p>

<p>Just then another friendly flash of lightning
illuminated the heavens, and for the space of
several seconds the prairie was lighted up almost
like day. And the two pioneer boys,
staring toward the region where the storm
seemed brooding, saw a spectacle that chilled
their blood, it was so wonderful, so full of tremendous
possibilities for evil!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE BUFFALO STAMPEDE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> away, it seemed as though the whole
surface of the prairie was in motion. To the
right and left the boys had seen the same bewildering
sight. Roger failed to comprehend
what it meant, and turned to his companion for
an explanation.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dick?” he called out.</p>

<p>“Buffaloes—one of those great herds
we’ve been told about, and which stretches as
far as the eye can reach!” the other replied.</p>

<p>“But will they come this way; and ought
we saddle up so as to be ready to make a run
for it?” Roger continued; not because he was
timid, but that the sight of that endless, heaving
mass of moving animals had impressed
him strongly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we should,” Dick replied.
“If the storm comes along after them, and
starts a stampede, as they call it, we would
stand in danger of being trampled under ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
thousand hoofs. No one could ever tell what
had become of us. So let’s roll up our
blankets, and get the horses; quick, Roger,
because they’re heading in our direction, and
coming right along.”</p>

<p>Indeed, even as they brought the snorting
horses in, and started to fasten the loads on
their backs, the rumble had increased to a
steady roar, so that it seemed to Roger he
could actually feel the ground vibrate under
the pounding of those myriad of hoofs, as the
heavy animals galloped toward the river.</p>

<p>Whenever the lightning flashed, and this
was more frequently than before, with peals
of thunder following, both boys found themselves
compelled to shoot quick glances of both
curiosity and alarm toward the advancing
peril. And what they saw was a sight never
to be forgotten.</p>

<p>It was like the border of a troubled sea, that
tremendous line of moving animal life, heaving
and tossing, and coming steadily on like a
dust cloud impelled by the wind. As yet they
could not distinguish the units comprising this
immense whole; but it was easy to imagine
them, for both boys had shot buffaloes before
now, and knew what they were like, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
they had never looked upon a herd of more
than half a dozen at a time.</p>

<p>“Oh! there must be millions in that lot!”
cried Roger, when a particularly vivid flash
came, that showed them the whole level
stretch covered with the advancing horde as
far as their eyes could reach.</p>

<p>“Too many for us to stay here, and try to
divide!” Dick answered.</p>

<p>“How lucky that you noticed where the
trees grew along the river,” said Roger; “because
that will be our best chance, don’t you
think, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the sooner we’re off the better,”
was the other’s answer.</p>

<p>He knew that their horses must still be tired
from the long journey of the day before, and,
laden as they were, might not be able to run as
swiftly as under other conditions. Just how
fast that avalanche of shaggy forms could advance
he had no means of knowing. If further
frightened by the flash of lightning, and the
crash of thunder, a stampede of the herd would
mean that the bison would come on the full
gallop, madly seeking to find shelter from the
howling blast.</p>

<p>“Have we got everything, do you think?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
asked Roger, ready to mount his horse, which
could hardly be held in hand, such was its terror
at the approach of this thundering mass
of heavy beasts; it was as though the intelligent
animal understood the danger that threatened,
and wanted to be on the move.</p>

<p>“No matter, we cannot afford to waste another
minute hunting for anything now. Our
lives are worth more than any other thing we
possess. Get in your saddle, quick, Roger;
and be careful not to let the horse throw you,
or all is lost!”</p>

<p>The warning came not any too soon, for the
fretful animal was jumping and tugging at the
bridle, trying the best it could to break away,
so that it might dash off, and keep a space between
that approaching peril and its fleet
heels.</p>

<p>But Roger was a pretty fair horseman, and
succeeded in mounting, in spite of all the
prancing of the steed. Then away they went,
helter-skelter, allowing the horses to have
their heads.</p>

<p>They tried to keep as near to one another
as possible. The one danger Dick feared more
than anything else was that one of the horses
in this headlong gallop might set his feet in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
marmot hole, and bring about disaster; for a
spill in the face of the oncoming army of buffaloes
would mean that the unfortunate one
must be trampled under foot, whether his
horse had a leg broken or not.</p>

<p>When first seen the buffaloes had apparently
been simply galloping steadily on, as though
bent on changing their feeding grounds; but
Dick, turning to look with each flash, believed
he could detect a change coming over their
method of advance.</p>

<p>This was doubtless caused by the increasing
crashes of thunder that sounded high above
the steady roar of those tens of thousands of
hoofs beating upon the hard turf. In other
words, as the oncoming storm began to overtake
the drove, their gallop was fast degenerating
into a stampede, when every animal
would put on its best spurt, and, wild with
fear, seek to outrun the threatening gale.</p>

<p>Already the horses were doing their best,
and it was folly to dig one’s heels into the
sides of his straining beast, as Roger was doing,
seeking to obtain a little more speed.</p>

<p>And now both boys began to look anxiously
ahead. Despite the best efforts of the horses
it seemed as though the leading buffaloes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
much closer to them than when the mad race
had started; and this meant that, unless they
could manage to gain the shelter of the trees,
they were going to have a hard time of it
avoiding disaster.</p>

<p>Already Roger had learned that his comrade
had guessed true when he said that the indistinct
line along the horizon, seen just at sunset,
must be trees. They had become much
more distinct by now, so that, although but a
fleeting glimpse of them could be obtained
when the lightning flashed, still that was
enough.</p>

<p>And now the rain started to fall, but neither
cared for that, if only it did not interfere with
their striking the timber belt at its nearest
point.</p>

<p>Probably neither of those boys would ever
forget that wild ride, with the thunder booming
all around them; the lightning seeming to
strike here, there, and everywhere; the rain
falling in a deluge that soon soaked them to
the skin; and, worst of all, that endless line
of galloping bison gaining constantly, as they
were urged on by their fright.</p>

<p>Once Roger’s horse stumbled, and the boy
came near falling, only retaining his seat because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
he had firmly fixed himself there. His
heart seemed to jump into his throat with a
sudden fear lest the animal had lamed itself,
and would prove unequal to the task of keeping
ahead of the oncoming herd.</p>

<p>But, so far as could be seen, the horse did
not show any signs of injury.</p>

<p>“Can we make it, Dick?”</p>

<p>It was necessary for Roger to shout, although
at the time he could not have been ten
feet away from his companion. The combination
of noises all around them prevented such
a small thing as a human voice from being
heard, unless strained to the utmost.</p>

<p>“Looks like it! keep up your heart,
Roger!” was the cheery reply.</p>

<p>But, although Dick spoke in this manner, he
was not so very sure that the tired horses
would be equal to the test. He almost hated
to glance backward now, for it seemed to him
that the advance of that endless line of pursuers
must be overtaking them rapidly. Perhaps
that was only his fears magnified; but
it impressed Dick disagreeably, nevertheless.</p>

<p>In vain he racked his brain to conjure up
some means by which their progress might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
increased. Even if they could take the time
to detach some of the various packages with
which they had loaded their horses, it was
doubtful if such a sacrifice would avail to any
considerable extent, and so Dick dismissed it
as useless.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/i174.jpg" width="317" height="500" alt="racing away on horses" />
<div class="caption">“WHEN THE THUNDER STOPPED BOOMING FOR A FEW SECONDS THEY COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THOSE COUNTLESS HOOFS BEHIND THEM.”</div>
</div>

<p>The best hope that he had lay in the chance
that the trees might be somewhat nearer than
they believed to be the case, owing to the impossibility
of correctly gauging distances while
the rain was falling, driven by the wind, and
the deceptive lightning held sway.</p>

<p>At any rate, all they could do was to hang on,
and trust to good fortune to carry them to
safety. The horses were fully conscious of
their danger, and could be trusted to head for
the river. Besides, Dick kept his senses about
him all the while, for he knew what it might
mean if he allowed himself to give way.</p>

<p>When the thunder stopped booming for a
few seconds they could hear the roar of those
countless hoofs behind them. It had at least
one good element about it—it spurred their
horses on.</p>

<p>Had it been daylight, or even a clear, moonlight
night, Dick might have managed to alter
his course so as to strike the trees at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
point nearer than the one the frightened
horses were aiming for. But in such a storm
one could only keep straight ahead, and trust
to luck for the rest.</p>

<p>Roger, for once at least, had no suggestion
to make. True, he looked backward at times
as though almost ready to turn at bay, and
face that rolling mass of tossing black horns
and shaggy heads; but the folly of such a thing
must have impressed itself upon him immediately,
for he kept beside his companion
throughout the entire ride.</p>

<p>His one bullet, even granting that it found
a victim, would have counted no more than a
grain of sand on the seashore. And after he
had fired his bolt the end must have overwhelmed
him instantly; for that resistless
tide would sweep on, and every object
in its path would be blotted out of existence.</p>

<p>It seemed to Roger that his nerves had
reached a point where they could stand no
more. And then he heard Dick give vent to a
loud shout, not of new alarm, but with a ring
of triumph in it; and surely never did the
sound of human voice break upon the ears of
Roger Armstrong with a sweeter cadence than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
when he grasped the tenor of what his companion
was calling:</p>

<p>“The trees, Roger, the trees are at hand!
Keep it up for five minutes more, and it will
be all right!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>SAFE IN THE TIMBER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> five minutes seemed a terribly long
time to Roger. He could hear the oncoming
herd close at hand now, so that stragglers began
to pass them by on either side, and this
fact gave new alarm. What if one of the
buffalo chose to turn and gore the nearest
horse with its wicked horns? Even though
only a wound followed, it would mean a spill,
and that would be the same as the end of it all.</p>

<p>But evidently the frightened animals had all
they wanted to do in looking out for their own
affairs. Perhaps they considered the running
horses, with those queer bunches on their
backs, only in the light of some singular fellow
animals, seeking safety in flight. Roger had
heard it said that, when a fire chased over
these vast prairies, all manner of wild animals—deer,
wolves, and buffaloes—ran side by
side, only concerned in making their escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
He had heard his father read out of the Bible
about the time when the lion and the lamb
would lie down together, and he guessed that
it would be something like this universal fear
that must bring it about.</p>

<p>The trees began to loom up ahead, and both
lads began to feel a new concern with regard
to how they could manage, first of all, to pass
in among the sheltering timber, so as to avoid
meeting with an accident; and then, after this
had been accomplished, escape being crushed
in the dense mass of buffaloes that would be
surging forward, bent on finding a haven from
the pelting rain.</p>

<p>“Be careful now, Roger!” shouted Dick, as
they passed the first outlying tree.</p>

<p>It required considerable control over the
laboring horses to keep from colliding with
the obstacles that began to be strewn across
their path; but by degrees the boys managed
to regain control over their steeds, which were
almost winded, on account of their long run;
and after that it was not so difficult.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the river proved to be close at
hand, and, finding that there was an open
stretch of beach bordering it, Dick led the way
along this, his object being to reach a point as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
far up-stream as possible, so as to get beyond
the range of the buffalo herd.</p>

<p>Now their horses were floundering knee-deep
in the water, and again running along
the shore; but all the while making progress,
and that satisfied the two lads.</p>

<p>“That was as close a shave as we ever had,
Dick!” called out Roger, who was in the rear,
quite content for once to let his cousin do the
leading, for he was still quivering with the
recent excitement, and could hardly believe
that they had come out of it with whole
skins.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s a good thing for us this little
stretch runs along the edge of the water,” was
what the other answered back.</p>

<p>“Listen to the buffaloes coming into the
timber. There seems to be no end to them.
Do you think they’ll crowd down to the water
before we can get above the edge of the drove?
Is there any end to it, Dick?” (<a id="Note_4r"></a><a href="#Note_4">Note 4</a>.)</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” replied Dick, “and already I
think we’re getting to where there are not so
many, for the sound of their hoofs seems less.
Keep right on coming, Roger, and in the end
we’ll have a fire, and dry off.”</p>

<p>“That suits me, because already I’m shivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with the cold. This thing of riding at top
speed with a wet jacket isn’t much fun, Dick,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>So long as there was danger that they might
be trampled under the hoofs of the herd, Roger
had not given his soaked condition a single
thought, for the excitement kept him up. It
was only after safety seemed assured that he
could allow himself to consider his feelings;
and then, as he said, he discovered that he was
shaking all over.</p>

<p>Dick proved a true prophet, for after a while
they managed to get to a point that seemed to
be beyond the limits of the vast drove.
Further down the river they could hear the
greatest splashing imaginable, as thousands of
the beasts pushed into the water, either to
drink, or because the press behind was so
great as to crowd them off the bank.</p>

<p>Roger was only too willing to pull up when
Dick gave the word.</p>

<p>The rain had stopped entirely, and the mutter
of thunder was only heard now in the distance,
showing that the storm was past.</p>

<p>So the two young pioneers jumped to the
ground, and the first thing they did was to slap
their chilled arms vigorously back and forth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
after the customary method of starting a circulation
of the blood.</p>

<p>“Now, how about a fire?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“Wait until we stake the horses, and then
I’ll hunt around for an old stump, or a log,
from which to tear the dry heart to make a beginning,”
Dick declared.</p>

<p>Of course these boys, having roamed the
woods in search of game since they were capable
of handling one of the long-barreled rifles
known to the settlers of the day, understood
just how to go about getting fire, no matter if
everything around them seemed to be soaking
wet.</p>

<p>Having found the needed stump, Dick used
knife and hatchet, and presently announced
that he had enough dry tinder to make a
start.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roger had also been collecting
twigs that would be apt to take fire quickly,
and had selected the site on which the cheery
blaze should be built. In doing this he had
been influenced in some measure by the idea
of hiding the fire as much as possible, although
the boys did not believe hostile eyes
could see it in the thick timber.</p>

<p>Once Dick had got out his tinder box, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
his flint and steel, there was little time wasted
in sending the spark where it glowed amidst
the inflammable stuff, being quickly fanned into
a tiny flame by the breath of the fire-maker.
Matches may be a great invention, and a labor-saving
device, but in those pioneer days, under
favorable conditions it was amazing how rapidly
an expert could light a fire. And in rainy
weather the “matches” did not get wet,
which must have been more or less of a consolation.</p>

<p>It certainly did feel good to crouch near that
hot little blaze, and let their wet garments
steam on them, gradually feeling warmer, and
in this manner drying.</p>

<p>The boys knew that they could not sleep
again that night, so there was no use trying.
Accordingly they sat there, keeping their small
fire going, and talking of the thousand-and-one
things connected with their mission, and
the wonderful experiences through which they
were passing.</p>

<p>When the clouds parted overhead, and they
could see the stars, it was possible for either
of them to give a good guess as to how the
night was passing; for, since watches were almost
unknown among the settlers, every boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was taught to read the heavenly bodies, and
to observe things that might be passing around
him.</p>

<p>So Dick and Roger knew just about when
certain bright planets should set or rise; and
a glance upward at any time when the sky was
clear was sufficient to tell them how the day
or night might be passing.</p>

<p>“We’ll have daylight in less than two
hours,” Dick announced, when the break in
the clouds came, allowing him to consult his
“clock.”</p>

<p>“And when it comes,” Roger returned,
with a shake of his head, “do you know what
I intend to do? Why, try for a young buffalo
with my bow and arrows. I never yet had the
chance to shoot such a big animal with that
Indian bow. If it can bring down an elk, why
not a buffalo? And let me tell you, after the
fright they gave us, I feel more like feasting
on buffalo meat than ever before.”</p>

<p>Dick declared that he would have no objection
to tasting more fresh meat; and so it was
arranged that, while he stayed with the outfit,
Roger should set out for a little hunt.</p>

<p>He promised not to wander far away, and
to stick to the timber belt. When Dick spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of this latter condition his companion laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t catch me stepping out
on that prairie on foot with all those savage
bulls around, no, sir, not if I was paid to do
it,” he declared. “It was bad enough to be
chased while we had our horses to depend on,
and, let me tell you, I don’t hanker after trying
a foot race.”</p>

<p>When the time did come he started off, while
Dick busied himself in the camp, for there
were numerous duties to be looked after, besides
keeping the fire going. In their mad
gallop the horses had managed to get some of
the bundles disturbed, which was not surprising,
and these had to be rearranged.</p>

<p>Hardly an hour had passed when Dick heard
a joyous whoop, and, looking up, as his hand
involuntarily reached out toward his ready firearm,
he discovered his camp-mate staggering
in, bearing a package of meat done up in a portion
of hide.</p>

<p>“You were lucky, then, I see,” ventured
Dick, as the other threw his burden down.</p>

<p>“It was as easy a job as I ever had,” replied
Roger, panting a little after his exertions.
“Why, Dick, I could have shot a dozen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
if I’d wanted, they were so thick through the
timber, and seemed to be wanting to just lie
there and rest. The hardest thing was to get
a chance to cut up my game, after it had fallen.
You see, I was afraid some old bull might take
a notion to charge me; but I managed it all
right, and without any fight, either.”</p>

<p>“I hope you got a yearling, then,” remarked
the camp guard, as he started to open
the meat pack.</p>

<p>“Just what I did,” replied Roger. “With
all those around to choose from, I picked the
very choicest and fattest in sight. Oh! I can
hardly wait to get some in the pan, I’m so
hungry.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that even the great
buffalo stampede, that at one time had threatened
to bring the journey of the young pioneers
to a speedy termination, was the means
of supplying them with food.</p>

<p>When the fresh meat was done to a turn,
both lads pronounced it the very finest they
had ever eaten; and somehow it seemed to remove
some of the sting from their inglorious
night gallop in front of the panic-stricken herd.</p>

<p>Then once more the forward movement was
resumed; for their determination to overtake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the expedition that was piercing the Western
wilderness had not abated. Accustomed to
meeting and overcoming difficulties, the boys
thought little of things that might seem discouragements
in the eyes of those less trained
in the ways of borderers and hunters.</p>

<p>No doubt they would see more of these
shaggy animals, if they stayed any length of
time upon the prairies along the upper Missouri,
for at that time the buffalo entered
largely into all the history of the many Indian
tribes living west of the Mississippi, and pictures
of its chase could be found painted on
thousands of the skin teepees used by the red
hunters. Its meat, when dried, afforded their
families sustenance through the long winters,
and the annual drive, when hundreds of the
ungainly beasts would be killed, was an event
that took place every autumn. If the buffalo
failed to show up in numbers, it promised to be
a lean year for that unfortunate tribe, and the
hunters would have to keep busy after the
ground was knee-deep in snow, trying to bring
in moose, caribou, or other animals that did
not migrate each season to the warmer southland.</p>

<p>It was only fair that a period of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
should follow after a storm; and for many
days the boys met with no particular adventure,
but continued to make good time along
the river.</p>

<p>At the same time they did not seem to be
gaining to any appreciable extent on the explorers
who were pushing on ahead; which
fact gave Roger occasional fits of the blues, so
that his companion was compelled to again
show him that sooner or later they were bound
to attain their end. For Captain Lewis had,
before starting, announced that he expected to
spend the winter somewhere short of the great
mountain chain, which, it was believed, ran
north and south somewhere in the distant
country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE PERILS OF THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I wonder</span> if he saw us?” Roger was saying,
some days after the buffalo stampede.</p>

<p>The boys were thinking of halting for the
night, and the western sky had taken on all
the wonderful rosy tints at which even these
frontier boys would gaze with something akin
to awe.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” his companion returned, with
a troubled look on his sunburned face; “because
that might mean new perils before morning.
Up to now we’ve been so lucky about escaping
any sort of fight with the wandering
Indians that I keep hoping we may get
through, and join the expedition, without any
annoyance.”</p>

<p>“But it <i>was</i> a redskin, all right, Dick; both
of us saw him plain enough to be very sure of
that,” Roger went on.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, I grant that,” was Dick’s answer;
“but he wasn’t in evidence on that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
rise more than a few minutes. We kept our
horses standing still all the time, in the hope
that he might not notice us. He shaded his
eyes with his hand, because he was looking
into the west, and that light must have partly
blinded him. I only hope it was strong enough
to make him miss seeing us here.”</p>

<p>“Are we going on now?” queried the other,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“That’s the only thing left to us, Roger.
By sticking close to the foot of the rise, where
there are some trees to give us shelter, we
may escape being seen. But no galloping for
us now; just let the horses walk until the dusk
comes down on us. Then we’ll make camp,
somehow.”</p>

<p>“How lucky that I cooked enough of that
meat at noon to last another meal. That was
a time when I had my head about me, eh,
Dick?” the other asked.</p>

<p>“It looks that way, because we must light
no fire if there’s a hunting party of hostile
Indians around here,” Dick decided.</p>

<p>They let the tired animals walk, keeping to
the edge of the little hill beyond which, though
at some little distance, lay the river.</p>

<p>Roger, grown very suspicious now, turned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his saddle many times to glance in all directions.
He thought more than once that he saw
a crouching Indian behind some tree or bush,
and his gun almost involuntarily started to
leap to his shoulder. But in every case it
turned out to be some deceptive shadow, and
Roger was the first one to laugh at his own
silly fears.</p>

<p>Gradually the glorious red tints died out of
the western heavens; and with their passing
came the troops of skirmishing shadows that
told of the night.</p>

<p>Dick had meanwhile kept on the alert, not
only to discover any lurking foe, but at the
same time find a suitable spot where they
could make their camp.</p>

<p>When he located a place that seemed to
promise them fair shelter, and at the same
time a feeding spot for their horses, he drew
rein.</p>

<p>“We might as well pull up here, and settle
down for the night, Roger,” he announced.</p>

<p>So they proceeded to stake the horses out,
making their own arrangements so as to be
very close to the feeding animals. The grass
was sweet and plentiful, and, as the horses
were hungry, they started cropping it without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
delay, glad to be relieved from their burdens,
for the day had been a hot one.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Roger, as they started to
arrange things so as to have at least some sort
of comfort, “it might be wise not to undo most
of our packages, since we don’t mean to make
a fire.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to say that myself,” the
other rejoined. “Then, if we wanted to get
away from here in a hurry, we’d be in condition
to do so.”</p>

<p>“Then you still have a little idea we were
seen by that lone brave, Dick; and that he may
bring the rest of the hunting party down on us
to-night?”</p>

<p>“It seems to strike me that way; and so we
must keep a better watch even than usual to-night,”
Dick observed, as he accepted some of
the food his comrade took out of a package,
and started to munch at it with that contentment
the boys of those days learned to exhibit.</p>

<p>“We’ve been so lucky all these weeks, while
following after the expedition, not to meet a
single enemy face to face—unless you’d count
that half-breed. If he was with François Lascelles
we must have given them the slip nicely,
don’t you think, Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks that way,” Dick answered, between
bites. “Pass me the old canteen that
we filled with water at that fine spring late this
afternoon, and I’ll wash down this dry meat.
We’ve been delayed so many times now that
the summer is passing away; and, after all,
it begins to look as if we might come up with
Captain Lewis just when he’s thinking of stopping
over to pass the winter. You know we
heard him say he felt sure he’d have to do that
somewhere short of the big mountains the Indians
tell such strange stories about, when
bringing in their pelts to the trading posts.”</p>

<p>“But no matter, we’re bound to keep on, if
it takes us all the way to the ocean—I’ve
heard you say that more than once, Dick, and
I know you meant it, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m just as determined as when we
started out to overtake the expedition, and
have that paper signed by Jasper Williams.
Every time I shut my eyes when trying to go
to sleep I can see my father’s troubled face,
and how well do I remember discovering the
tears in mother’s eyes as she looked around
the little home, for I know she was thinking
how it would break her heart to have to give
it up now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must never happen, Dick. After coming
this far we <i>must</i> succeed, and save the
homes of our parents for them. I am twice as
set on that as when we first started out. Think
of all we’ve gone through; and yet it seems
as if the Good Captain above must be watching
over us, to keep all harm from overtaking
us. Yes, we are going to succeed, if pluck and
love can pull us through!”</p>

<p>In this manner the two boys buoyed up each
other’s courage. Nor was it at all strange that
there arose now and then some necessity for
such a thing. The task which they had set for
themselves might have well given grown men,
experienced forest rangers, cause for hesitation
and doubt. The hidden perils of this unknown
country had been the subject of campfire
talk ever since the lads knew anything;
and unconsciously their young minds had been
impressed with the idea that many kinds of
fierce animals inhabited the country far beyond
the Mississippi, in the Land of the Setting
Sun. And then there were numerous
tribes of warlike Indians roving over the
plains, and through the forests in uncounted
numbers, and great beasts, the like of which
the eyes of hunters had never before seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
having their homes among the sky-piercing
mountains lying like a barrier far toward the
distant ocean.</p>

<p>The darkness closed in even as they ate their
frugal meal and conversed in low whispers.
Roger was more than ever on the alert. The
many little sounds of the night caused him to
listen, and try to determine whether the shrill
cry of the cricket, or the monotonous call of
the katydid were genuine, or some signal of
creeping enemies.</p>

<p>When a whippoorwill suddenly gave out his
loud notes from a neighboring tree, the nervous
Roger started as if he had been shot, and
even thrust forward a hand, as though ready
to snatch up his gun.</p>

<p>When finally they had finished eating, Dick
seemed to have made up his mind to something
that had been worrying him.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Roger,” he said, impressively;
“I was just thinking of what old Pat
O’Mara told us once, of when he was in a dangerous
land, and feared that the Indians might
know of his camp. You remember he changed
his location as soon as darkness covered his
movements. And he was glad he’d done so,
because, later on in that same night, he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
shots and yells in the quarter where he had
been; and knew that the redskins were pouncing
on the dummy figure he had left beside a
little fire. We must do the same thing now. I
wouldn’t sleep easily unless we made a move.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Dick; you’re the chief of
the expedition, you know. But do you really
think that Indian saw us, and perhaps followed
us?”</p>

<p>“I seem to have an idea that way,” replied
the other; “several times I thought, when I
turned my head and looked back, that I saw a
branch fall into place, just as if some one
might be watching us from behind the green
covert. And once I even believed I saw a
shadowy figure flit from tree to tree. No matter
if it is a false alarm, Roger; it is better to
be on the safe side, as father says.”</p>

<p>“All right, whenever you say the word we’ll
make the move,” Roger returned, “and how
fortunate that we didn’t undo our stuff any
more than we had to, in getting the blankets
out. Shall I bring the horses in now, Dick, so
we can load up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is pitch dark, and we can creep on
without any one seeing us, Roger. Besides, if
that red spy did follow at our heels, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he saw that we meant to make camp here he
must have marked the spot well in his mind,
and then slipped off to hunt up the rest of the
party. Perhaps they may be miles away, and
it would take him hours to find them.”</p>

<p>Roger soon had the horses ready. Then the
tired boys started off. They did not venture
to mount, but walked ahead of their animals,
leading them. This was on account of the
darkness, which was so intense that neither
could see more than ten feet ahead; and even
at that distance the trees bordering the little
rise looked dim and uncanny, as though they
might be ghosts—at least, that was the way
they appeared to the imagination of Roger.</p>

<p>For half an hour they walked along in this
fashion, sometimes stumbling over obstacles
they could not see, but making steady progress
all the while.</p>

<p>“I think we have come far enough, now,”
remarked Dick, finally, as he stopped in his
tracks.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m glad to hear you say that!” exclaimed
the other, with a long drawn sigh, for
he was very tired after that hot day’s journey.</p>

<p>They soon had the horses staked out again,
close at hand. Neither of the boys expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to get very much sleep that night, for there
seemed to be some strange foreboding in the
atmosphere, that affected them.</p>

<p>As they had done on many another occasion,
the boys divided the night into watches, each
taking turn and turn about in keeping awake.</p>

<p>It was a moonless night, though the stars
were bright enough. After a warm day, the
myriads of insects seemed to be unusually
noisy, and kept up a chorus that was soothing,
rather than irritating, to the senses of Dick
Armstrong, as he sat with his back braced
against the trunk of a small tree.</p>

<p>Roger was sound asleep alongside; and, sitting
there, Dick could hear the constant cropping
of the horses as they continued to make
a supper from the grass that grew in the open
spaces, and still preserved its sweetness,
despite the lateness of the season.</p>

<p>Now and again some distant sound would
cause him to raise his head to listen; it might
be the weird howl of a prairie wolf, the strange
cry of a coyote, a new animal to both boys; or
the hoot of an owl perched in some dead tree,
and signaling to its mate.</p>

<p>But the night wore on, without anything out
of the ordinary occurring, and Dick even began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to imagine that his fears must have been
groundless. Still, he could not regret having
taken precautions; for it paid to be on the
safe side always.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly sat upright. His manner
indicated that his quick ears had caught some
sound, however trifling, that seemed out of the
common, and therefore, under the circumstances,
suspicious.</p>

<p>It was as if a stone had been dislodged somewhere
up on the little ridge, and in rattling
down the side, caused a small avalanche. Still,
a roving animal might have been the cause.</p>

<p>Dick turned his eyes upward. The top of
the ridge happened to be devoid of undergrowth,
and was sharply outlined against the
starry heavens. One of the greatest of the
planets was just about to set, and hovered
above the ridge, as if on the point of sending
out the last flickering gleam before dropping
from sight.</p>

<p>Even as the boy sat there and looked, he saw
something pass before this bright star. It was
erect, and on two feet, therefore not an animal;
moreover, Dick had seen the flutter of
feathers crowning the scalp-lock, and he knew
that it must be an Indian brave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Another, and still another flitted past, until
the startled lad had counted fully seventeen
of the noiseless figures. Then he knew that
they were heading toward the very spot where
he and Roger had first intended spending the
night, proving that the spy, after locating
them, had indeed hurried away to summon his
red companions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A CLOSE CALL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> almost held his breath until the last
dark figure had flitted past. His greatest fear
had been that in some manner the keen ears of
the Indians might detect the presence of horses
down near the foot of the elevation along
which they were making their way.</p>

<p>Dick waited a full minute after seeing the
party vanish before making a move. He
wished to be sure there were no stragglers
lingering behind. And when this seemed a certainty
he put out his hand, and gently shook
his comrade.</p>

<p>“’Sh!”</p>

<p>Roger, starting up, heard this warning
sound, and felt a thrill. He groped around
until he had laid hands on his gun, placed close
beside him when lying down to sleep.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dick?” he whispered, placing
his lips close to the other’s ear.</p>

<p>“Danger! We must get out of this right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
away,” replied the sentry, in an equally low
tone.</p>

<p>“Indians?” asked Roger, to make sure.</p>

<p>“Yes. A party has just passed along the
ridge. It was just our luck that they took this
place to come over the hogback, Roger.”</p>

<p>“You saw them, did you?” demanded
Roger.</p>

<p>“I did that; and counted seventeen,” replied
Dick, impressively; “all stepping in
each other’s tracks. One must have started
a stone rolling down, for its clatter made me
look up. They went past like ghosts, and vanished
below the rim, still heading that way.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! you mean in the direction of our
first camp, don’t you, Dick? Then that lone
hunter must have sighted us, even if he did
pretend not to. How wise you were to change
camps. Seventeen, you say; what could two
boys do against that many braves? What
next, Dick? I’m ready to do anything you say.
Must we push on again, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, because when they find that the birds
have flown they will surely look this way for
us. By that time we ought to be miles off.”</p>

<p>They set about making the move without
more delay, though not hurrying in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
manner as to invite discovery through neglect
of precautions.</p>

<p>The poor horses no doubt thought it pretty
hard that they should be made to start out
afresh without even a nap; but they were
patient beasts and had no way of expressing
their opinions, or showing signs of mutiny at
being made to work overtime.</p>

<p>Once again did the boys lead the animals,
for the darkness was too intense to trust to
keeping their eyes so far away from the
ground, when there was so much necessity for
their discovering the presence of logs and pitfalls
before the horses stumbled. Roger, if
left to himself, would possibly have climbed
into his saddle, and trusted to the instinct of
his animal to detect obstacles in the way, but
Dick was too cautious for that.</p>

<p>So they plodded on. It was weary work, but
the knowledge that a deadly peril lurked near
inspired the boys to endure the fatigue
bravely.</p>

<p>“You seem to be veering off to the side,
Dick; we’re getting farther and farther away
from that ridge, back of which lies the river.
What is that for?” asked Roger, after a
while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the first place,” replied the other, always
willing to explain, “when the Indians
find out that we’ve slipped away, they are
likely to scatter, and search the woods for
miles, believing that they may get trace of us
in that way. Then, Roger, I’m too tired to
think of keeping up this walk long. I want to
get in the saddle, and ride, which we can do if
once we find the open country.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Dick; I’ll be glad myself
when we can mount, and coax the horses to a
gait faster than a walk,” Roger declared.</p>

<p>Several times Dick had paused. He seemed
to be listening, and it was not difficult for his
companion to guess why.</p>

<p>“Do you expect to hear them give tongue
when they find the nest empty?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied his cousin. “They
will be bitterly disappointed, that goes without
saying; and when they strike a light, and
start to following our tracks, as I’m sure they
will do, we will probably hear them. Listen,
Roger. What did I tell you?”</p>

<p>The night wind chanced to be coming from
a point almost directly back of them, so that
sounds were carried on its breath. First came
a long quavering cry that seemed to be filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
with bitter disappointment. Then followed a
series of quick, angry yelps, that made Roger
think of a pack of fighting dogs.</p>

<p>“They know now that we’ve given them the
slip, don’t they, Dick?” chuckled Roger, whom
even the recent peril did not seem to have
daunted.</p>

<p>“They certainly do,” answered the other.</p>

<p>“But here is what seems to be another little
rise on our left, Dick,” observed Roger, as
what looked like a secondary ridge arose between
them and the star-studded heavens.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been noticing that for some little
while now,” Dick answered. “And I’m sure
that just on the other side lies the level prairie
that we want to reach soon.”</p>

<p>“Then we must cross over that divide; is
that the way, Dick?”</p>

<p>“When we come to a place where we can do
it without exposing ourselves too much. Remember
how I happened to discover the seventeen
braves, Roger; though they would be too
far away, perhaps, to see us crossing over.
And here seems to be the right spot to make
the attempt. I hope we find a trail for the
horses, because they are not able to climb
rocks as we can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time later they were slowly but
steadily passing up from the little valley that
lay like a swale between the two slight ridges.</p>

<p>“This is all right, Dick,” remarked Roger,
when, after some toil, they managed to reach
what seemed to be the pinnacle of the “hogback,”
as the border boys called such a ridge.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if the going down is as easy, we
can thank our stars,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>Before starting the descent he turned and
looked long and earnestly in the direction
whence those cries of disappointment had
arisen a short time before.</p>

<p>“There, what did I tell you?” he exclaimed;
“look yonder, Roger, and you will
see something queer.”</p>

<p>“Are they fireflies, Dick?” questioned the
other; “they seem to look like it at this distance;
and yet I can see that they do not come
and go, but keep up a steady light.”</p>

<p>“If you were closer, Roger, you would see
that they were strange lightning-bugs; for
each one is a torch gripped in the hand of a
red-skinned warrior, who bends over and follows
the trail we made!”</p>

<p>“Oh! then we didn’t start away from our
second camp any too soon, did we, Dick?” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the younger lad, breathlessly, as he
watched the lights that really did look like
flickering fireflies in the distance.</p>

<p>“No; and now we’d better be getting off
this high ground before they come close
enough to discover us,” Dick remarked.</p>

<p>“But what is going to be the end of all this
running about?” asked Roger. “Do we have
to keep on the jump all night? See, the stars
tell us it is even now close on midnight, for
there is that other bright one just going to set.
I’ve had two hours or more of sleep, but you
haven’t yet closed your eyes, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s time enough for that after
we’ve left these red rascals miles behind,
Roger. Once we strike the level prairie it’s
going to be a job urging our horses on by digging
heels into their sides, much as I hate to
do it. There is a limit to the distance even
hardy braves can walk, following a trail by
torchlight; and we’ll put a lot of ground between
us before we rest.”</p>

<p>They found that it was not very difficult to
pass down the other side of the slope, for their
horses were sure-footed, and the way far from
being impassable. And presently the bottom
was gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Here there were a few scattered trees, that
gradually the boys left behind, until presently
the open prairie lay before them.</p>

<p>“Now to mount!” declared Dick, suiting
the action to the word.</p>

<p>Roger was not a whit behind him in climbing
into his saddle. It was no easy job doing
this on account of the many bundles with which
both horses were burdened, so that “climbing”
would seem to cover the case very well.</p>

<p>When the horses were urged to start off on
a gentle gallop Roger declared he felt very
much like giving a whoop, to signify his delight
at having so cleverly outwitted the red
foe; but his cousin advised him to hold his
breath.</p>

<p>“You know, Roger,” Dick said, in his quiet
but convincing way, “that old Pat O’Mara,
our father’s best friend, used to say an Indian
had no business to crow until he was in the
woods, and by the same token a white was a
fool to shout till he was well out of them. And
though we’re over the divide, and riding on
level country, we are not beyond the danger
line yet. So, if you’re wise, you’ll bottle up
that cheer until we see the expedition of Captain
Lewis, boats and horses, ahead of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>And of course Roger held his peace, for he
had considerable respect for the opinions of
his older companion.</p>

<p>They must have covered at least six or eight
miles before the horses showed unwillingness
to go farther without a rest. Dick then announced
that they had come far enough.</p>

<p>And so once more, for the third time that
night, the lads staked the animals out, and lay
down on their blankets under the twinkling
stars.</p>

<p>Roger insisted on his cousin taking a turn
at sleeping, while he sat there and kept vigil;
which Dick finally did, though a little loath to
shut his eyes. However, he secured quite a
few hours’ nap; and then Roger awakened
him, so that he might in turn get a little
more sleep before the coming of another
dawn warned them that it was time to
proceed.</p>

<p>Morning found them fairly rested after their
hard night, and so far as they could tell there
was no sign of the Indians. Evidently the
hunting party had given up all hope of overtaking
the fugitives when they found that the
horses had climbed the ridge and struck the
level country beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Another day and still others followed,
during which the boys kept sturdily heading
into the northwest. It seemed so strange to
them that, on account of the many hindrances,
they could not overtake the explorers, who
were always just a few days’ journey ahead of
them.</p>

<p>Of course this was caused by the fact that
the boys had frequently to make detours in
order to avoid Indian villages that they discovered
on the river bank; and in more than
a few cases these circuits were the cause of
their losing the river entirely, so that they
wasted one or more days hunting for it
again.</p>

<p>But their dogged determination to attain the
object which had caused them to start on their
undertaking never flagged. No matter what
difficulties beset them, they would keep everlastingly
at it until they had met with disaster,
or else succeeded in their quest.</p>

<p>It was this spirit of never-say-die that made
frontier boys develop into the resolute men
they afterwards became; and which caused
them to continually push out farther and
farther into the unknown land until finally
they had conquered the whole West, to transform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the wilderness into one vast fertile region,
where the grain to feed the nations of the
world was to be grown later on; and the vast
herds of long horned cattle were to graze by
hundreds of thousands, taking the place of the
vanishing bison.</p>

<p>Of course they met with many sights which
were novel to their eyes, and would always remain
fresh in their memories. But after all
these weeks of journeying over the prairie,
they were by degrees becoming quite familiar
with the conditions connected with this new
life; and as they became accustomed to them
the boys grew more adept in accepting chances
to creep up on antelope and scattered bison,
so as to secure a shot and thus provide themselves
with fresh meat.</p>

<p>On one occasion Dick had found an opportunity
to try a clever expedient that he had
heard spoken of by other hunters, but never
before practised himself.</p>

<p>It happened that several antelope were feeding
at some little distance from a hunch of
grass in which the hunter had ensconced himself,
in the hope that they would wander that
way.</p>

<p>He had his rifle, since on that level stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of ground it was not likely that any Indians
might hear the report, or if they did, attach
any special meaning to it.</p>

<p>Since the shy little animals did not seem to
be feeding that way, Dick realized that if he
hoped to get any fresh meat that day he must
resort to some ruse. Having a red handkerchief
with him, he conceived the idea of attempting
the trick those old hunters had
spoken about.</p>

<p>The antelope seems to have more than average
curiosity, and will allow this failing to
have full sway even when its instincts give
warning of danger.</p>

<p>So Dick, fastening this red kerchief to the
muzzle of his gun, waved it above the tuft of
grass behind which he lay concealed.</p>

<p>The timid animals soon noted the strange
bright object that waved in the breeze and at
first started to run away; then, halting, they
stared long and eagerly, by slow degrees coming
back, only to turn and run again. But
there seemed to be a fatal fascination in that
queer red banner which they found utterly impossible
to resist; and so closer and closer
they drew, quivering with suspense, and apparently
ready to fly if it should turn out to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
an enemy, relying on the speed of their heels
to carry them to safety.</p>

<p>But alas! they knew nothing of the “stick-that-spoke,”
and sent out a death-dealing
pellet of lead.</p>

<p>Dick had watched their coming and going,
and noted that each time they advanced just
a little farther than before. He believed that
he was going to be given the chance he craved
for a shot. This pleased him, for they had
been without fresh meat for three days.</p>

<p>Finally the young hunter believed the antelope
had come close enough, and that it
would be folly for him to wait any longer.</p>

<p>Accordingly he selected the one he thought
best suited for their purpose as food, and,
having disengaged the red handkerchief from
the end of his rifle, so that it might not interfere
with his aim, he quickly covered the body
of his intended victim with the white bead that
he used for an end-sight, and pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>At that the herd of antelope sped away like
the wind; but one did not keep company with
its mates, for the bullet of the hunter had laid
it low.</p>

<p>Dick felt more or less compassion for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
little animal when he saw how delicately it was
fashioned, and how innocent it appeared; but
then he had been a hunter ever since he could
lift his father’s rifle, and would not allow this
feeling to have dominion over him, especially
when they were in such need of fresh meat.
So he was cutting up the game when Roger,
who had kept the horses far away, came hurrying
to the spot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>BROUGHT TO BAY BY THE WOLF PACK</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> does this mean, Dick?” Roger
asked, some days later, when they started to
make a fire in the morning and found the air
quite cold. “Does winter come so early in
this northwestern country?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, it isn’t that,” replied the other;
“but, since the wind has whipped into the
north during the night, and there’s been a
storm somewhere, we’re in for a cool spell. I
hope frost is far from us, because we have so
much to do before that time. But a fire will
feel good, and I think we might take chances.”</p>

<p>They had not seen any signs of Indians for
some time now, but Dick was too cautious a
boy to relax his vigilance on this account.
Nevertheless, after the light of day had come,
he believed they could make a fire out of smokeless
wood that was not apt to betray their
presence in the vicinity.</p>

<p>During this day they journeyed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
dense timber, which was quite a change from
crossing the wide, level stretches of country
lying along so much of the upper reaches of
the Missouri.</p>

<p>All the time they had to make sure of several
things, especially the presence of the
river not far away; and then the important
fact that the exploring expedition sent out
through the efforts of President Jefferson was
still ahead of them.</p>

<p>It would have been a sad joke on the boys
had they managed in some manner to outstrip
the soldiers and voyageurs with Captains
Lewis and Clark, and in this way gone ahead
of them.</p>

<p>To make positive that this was not the case
they were compelled to keep close to the river,
looking for signs of an abandoned camping-place;
and when such was discovered they
found means to read the telltale evidence that
denoted just how many days’ journey in advance
were those they sought.</p>

<p>It was while they were jogging contentedly
along during this particular morning that
Dick suddenly drew rein, and raised a hand
with a movement that his companion understood
meant that he was to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>From some point ahead they caught peculiar
sounds—a snapping and crackling, accompanied
by dull thuds that mystified Roger
greatly.</p>

<p>“Why, what can that he, Dick?” he asked,
turning a perplexed face toward his companion,
and at the same time fingering his always
ready gun.</p>

<p>“Let’s move slowly forward, and find out
for ourselves,” was Dick’s suggestion, which
appeared to please his cousin, since both at
once urged the horses ahead.</p>

<p>As they kept on the noise increased in
volume; and accompanying the other sounds
they could now hear snortings, and what
seemed to be the snarls of beasts. Then came
a plain yelp as of pain, followed by more prancings,
and another of those dull thuds, as of a
heavy body striking another, the impact causing
the hollow sound.</p>

<p>“Seems like a fight,” said Roger, in a cautious
tone, not removing his eyes from in
front, where he now believed he could see the
bushes waving, as if various objects were in
motion beyond.</p>

<p>“That’s just what it must be,” Dick agreed.</p>

<p>In another minute they had reached a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
where they could look upon one of the tragedies
of the border, such as were in progress
in season and out, hundreds of years before
Columbus ever sailed into the western seas, to
find a new route to the East Indies, and
thereby discovered a new continent instead.</p>

<p>A noble old stag was at bay, with a pack of
hungry wolves trying their best to drag him
down. Already had he placed two of the gray
beasts on their backs, and several of the others
seemed to have suffered from contact with the
sharp points of his antlers.</p>

<p>They had succeeded in running him down;
perhaps a wound in one of his legs had prevented
the game old fellow from escaping as
easily as he might have done under ordinary
conditions. The boys never knew how it came
about; but there the stag was, with lowered
head, doing his best to defend himself against
his foes.</p>

<p>No doubt, had the combatants been left to
fight it out in their own way, the tenacious
wolves would in the end have pulled the old
stag down, and made a meal off his carcase;
for he seemed pretty well exhausted by this
time, and there were still half a dozen of the
savage brutes able to fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>But Roger could not stand such a spectacle.
He sympathized with the gallant old buck, and,
slipping from his horse, bow and arrow in
hand, crept forward, meaning to put in a few
“licks,” as he called them, in favor of the
animal that was outnumbered six to one.</p>

<p>Dick sat there, holding his rifle, and not
wishing to waste any of his precious ammunition
unless it seemed necessary. He knew he
could depend on his comrade not to injure the
brave buck, whose tough meat would be of
little use to them for food. And, after the way
in which he had fought the whole wolf pack, it
seemed as though he deserved a better fate
than being shot down.</p>

<p>The boy with the Indian bow succeeded in
creeping close enough to get a good view of the
performance. The actors in the forest tragedy
were too excited and intent on their business
to notice anything else. Even the usually
wary pests of the timber were goaded to fury
by this determined resistance on the part of
their intended prey, and seemed wild to bring
him down.</p>

<p>Roger never enjoyed anything more in his
life than when he took a quick aim, and sent a
feathered arrow flying toward the nearest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the pack. The beast went over in a heap, and
Dick chuckled when he saw the end of the
arrow projecting from that gray side.</p>

<p>Working like a machine Roger fitted another
missile to his how, and again that fatal twang
announced that the badgered stag had a new
ally close by; for a second wolf rolled over,
howling dismally.</p>

<p>By that time the balance of the pack began
to awaken to the fact that there was something
strange in the actions of their companions.
Perhaps they allowed themselves to ignore the
wounded stag for a moment, and sniff the air.
At any rate, there was a sudden flight on the
part of the four animals still able to run; and
the stag found himself master of the field.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Roger, unable to restrain
his feeling of elation as he stepped in
sight, waving his foxskin cap in triumph.</p>

<p>“Take care,” called out Dick, warningly,
“or the stag may turn on you; he doesn’t
know that you mean to be his friend; and it
would be a shame to have to kill him, after the
handsome way he stood off that pack!”</p>

<p>But the animal, while half disposed to attack
this newcomer, being doubtless flushed with
his apparent victory over the wolves, presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
deemed discretion the better part of
valor; for, turning, he went off at a limping
pace.</p>

<p>“Good-by, and good luck!” called Roger
after him, as he stepped forward to knock one
of the wounded wolves on the head with his
hatchet, so as to recover his two arrows.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances the boys
would gladly have halted to remove the skins
of the wolves that had fallen, where the antlers
of the stag had not ruined the pelts; but just
now they could not think of such a thing.
Their horses had all they could safely carry,
and it would be the height of folly to think of
increasing the load.</p>

<p>Although these lads had done considerable
hunting during the last five or six years this
happened to be the first time they had ever
been given a chance to witness one of those
forest battles which took place so often. True,
once they had found the skeletons of two deer
in the woods, and from the fact that their antlers
were interlocked tightly, so that they
could not possibly be pulled apart, it was evident
that in a fight the bucks had become so
attached to each other in this way that they
could not separate, and that consequently they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
had starved in the midst of plenty, falling victims
to their own passions.</p>

<p>On other occasions, when their journey led
them through the vast prairies, other matters
engaged their attention. Of course they had
to make camp where night found them; and
often it was far out on the billowy sea of grass,
where they built their small fire in a hole dug
in the ground, and spent the night in watchfulness
and security.</p>

<p>But sometimes these nights were not as
quiet and peaceful as they could wish. Until
recently neither of the boys had seen a cowardly
coyote; but often these scavengers of
the plains seemed to scent the fresh meat
which the boys had with them; and, taking up
positions a short distance from the camp, they
would make night hideous with their yelping.</p>

<p>After the boys had become accustomed to
this discordant chorus they minded it very
little. Had it been wolves they would have
kept constantly on the alert lest the treacherous
beasts pull down one of the horses; but
these thieving coyotes did not have the courage
to attempt such a bold deed, and could only
hang around, watching for a chance to steal
something when no one was looking. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
might be called the sneak-thieves of the plains,
while the gray wolf might be likened to the
dashing pirate—bold, aggressive, and sometimes
undaunted.</p>

<p>There was one night when these beggarly
coyotes seemed to be more persistent than
ever. Roger remarked that they came in
closer, and several times he looked as though
he would like nothing better than to go out
and try to “pot” a few by means of his ever-ready
bow.</p>

<p>However, Dick thought the animals hardly
worth noticing, since their cowardly traits
made them afraid to venture close enough to
steal anything.</p>

<p>Of course he raised no objections when his
companion declared he meant to set a trap,
and teach at least one sneaking coyote a lesson.
Roger was a clever hand at all sorts of
snares and liked nothing better than laying
one, whereby he might match his wits against
those of a cunning beast.</p>

<p>So, taking his hatchet, and some bits of
wood which they had brought along in case of
need in cooking supper, he began pounding
these down into the soft ground. In this way
he constructed what seemed to be an avenue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
about a foot broad, leading up to the place
where he expected to place the bait of his gun-trap.</p>

<p>Finally he fixed his rifle in such a manner
that it aimed directly down this enclosed section,
and if it were discharged any creature
between the parallel lines of stakes would be
very apt to get shot.</p>

<p>When the trap was set Roger chuckled, and
seemed to take considerable boyish pleasure in
anticipating the surprise of the hairy thief,
when, upon creeping stealthily along the limited
space, he snapped at the tempting bait,
only to have it apparently develop a sting, accompanied
by a crash like thunder.</p>

<p>Dick had watched all these preparations
with amusement. He knew how much pleasure
the other took in managing these little surprises,
for he had often observed Roger spending
time fixing a trap for a fox, or it might
be a bear. It had become what might be called
a hobby with the boy, and in such matters he
had few equals among the lads of the St. Louis
settlement.</p>

<p>“Remember, and don’t be frightened out of
your skin if you hear a shot some time to-night,
Dick,” was the warning the maker of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the trap gave, as he pronounced his work fit
for business.</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to,” observed the other, then
adding: “and I hope that if it succeeds, as
you expect, the sound won’t bring any hostile
Indians down on us. But at sundown there
was nothing in sight, and that was why we
dared to have our fire.”</p>

<p>It was just half an hour later that the boys
jumped as though they had been shot, when
the gun went off with a tremendous report.
Dick immediately burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“That’s a joke on you, Roger, as sure as
anything!” he exclaimed, when he could
speak; “telling me not to be alarmed when
your trap worked, and then nearly having a fit
yourself. But let’s look, and see if you got
your game.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt about that, for a dead
coyote was found in the passageway between
the stakes, looking for all the world like a thin,
half-starved dog. This was the first time
either of the boys had seen one of the animals
close, and Roger was disgusted to think he had
wasted a charge of powder and a bullet on the
miserable beast.</p>

<p>“That trap will do for once, but I’m done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
shooting such scurvy things,” he declared, as
he dragged the game out a short distance, and
left it, in the hope that some of the other
coyotes would dispose of it before morning;
which they certainly did, for they could soon
be heard snarling and quarreling as though
there were too many guests at the banquet.</p>

<p>After that, when the coyotes howled, and
made things disagreeable, Roger would take
up his gun, fondle it for a minute, as temptation
whispered at his heart, and then with a
shake of his head he would place it once more
on the ground as though he could not be coaxed
to come down to such poor shooting. And so
long as the miserable brutes kept clear of the
camp, and did not annoy their horses, the
chances were that they would be left alone to
continue their nightly serenade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE LOST RIVER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> several more days had passed, and
the boys found that they had again lost track
of the river in seeking to save time by making
a cut-off, Roger was very much downcast.</p>

<p>There was some reason for this, too, since
it had really been his fault; Dick thinking it
best to stick to the river, while his cousin argued
that they would gain a whole day by
saving the time spent in following the winding
course of the stream.</p>

<p>And so they had struck out, taking more
chances than were perhaps advisable under
the circumstances. And now neither could
say in which direction they must look in order
to once more come upon the river.</p>

<p>Dick did not attempt to chide his companion.
On the contrary, he even took a part of the
blame on his own shoulders, and in speaking
of the mistake, if such it should prove to be,
always used the words “<i>our</i> blunder.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
knew very well that Roger was suffering
enough without having “salt rubbed into his
open cuts.” And the chances were, no matter
how the experiment turned out, Roger after
that would be slow to insist on having his own
way.</p>

<p>Dick went about it in a cool, matter-of-fact
way. He consulted his crude little chart, made
up pretty much at a guess, for information
had come in a dozen roundabout ways, none of
which were strictly reliable. Then he took his
bearings with relation to the sun, their previous
course, and some other things that seemed
to have an intimate connection with the case.</p>

<p>After that he laid out a new trail, and
marked it on the map, explaining to his admiring
and now repentant companion just how
he believed they must head in order to once
again reach the Big Muddy.</p>

<p>“And I feel so sure that we will strike it by
keeping on toward the north that we must let
nothing turn us from that course,” he ended,
with a ring to his voice that told of determination.</p>

<p>“What if we run on to an Indian village,
because we are now in the country of the Shoshones,
you know?” Roger remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we’ll just wait for night,” replied
the other, quietly, “and pass the wigwams by
as close as we dare; for I would not want to
make too wide a circuit. And now let us make
a fresh start.”</p>

<p>This had been on the previous day to the
one on which we again find the undaunted lads
pushing directly into the north, bent on finding
the river again.</p>

<p>Once more had the character of the country
changed. The prairie had given place to rolling
land, where grew stretches of trees. In
the distance they could even see low elevations
that might be called hills. Roger had been
looking eagerly toward these, and hoping that
they would re-discover the Missouri among
them. Now that the river was lost it seemed to
have additional value in the eyes of the two
boys; and it was certain that they would welcome
the first glimpse of its swiftly flowing
waters with delight—at least Roger felt sure
he would.</p>

<p>The sun was getting rather low in the
heavens again, and once more they would soon
have to be looking for some place to pitch their
camp; but it was not so serious a matter when
surrounded by a forest, where wood was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
abundance, and numerous chances for hiding
a cooking fire abounded.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, both boys always felt more at
home when in the woods. They had been accustomed
to seeing trees all around them; and
those apparently endless level prairies, where
not a stick of timber could be seen as far as
their eyes traveled, rather appalled them, and
made them feel almost helpless. One had to
grow accustomed to these vast solitudes, and
the monotony of that waving sea of grass, before
he could feel at home.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes well about you as we ride
on, Roger,” Dick warned, not in a way to
create alarm in the mind of his companion, but
as though he wished to remind him that their
policy was always to be prepared for emergencies,
and never to be caught off their
guard.</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen any sign of Indians
around, I hope?” asked Roger, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, I’m glad to say not; but then there
are sometimes other dangers lurking in a wood
like this. They have panthers out here as well
as we did down near our homes. And, while
such a beast may never have set eyes on white
people before, I reckon he’d jump down at us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
just as quick as if we were red boys, if it so
happened that he was hungry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the panther is a sly beast, but when
pressed for a meal he will take chances every
time,” returned Roger. “You remember that
one we met in the timber on a winter’s day,
just as the snow-storm commenced to gather.
I saw him leave the limb just in the nick of
time. I think he gave a little snarl as he
sprang; and if it hadn’t been for that he might
have borne me to the ground. As it was I
managed to duck like a flash, so that he leaped
right over me; and before he could swing
around after recovering, your rifle had spoken,
and it was all up with Mr. Panther.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and cases are known when men have
been attacked openly on the trail by these gray
woods terrors,” Dick went on, as though the
subject possessed a certain fascination for
him.</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” Roger continued, “you
never know just how to take one of them.
Sometimes a panther may seem to be the biggest
coward going; and another day the same
beast wouldn’t hesitate at attacking three men.
Some hunters say they get crazy fits, and,
when one of these comes on, the person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
runs across a panther had better look out. But
if I see a ‘painter,’ as old Pat O’Mara used
to call them, I’m ready to give him the compliments
of my gun, and without any palaver,
too.”</p>

<p>After that they lapsed into silence, each
doubtless occupied with his thoughts. Indeed,
they had much pressing on their young minds
about this time, when the fate of their mission
was still in serious doubt. If it should fail,
and all their long trip have been taken for
nothing, they did not really know how they
should have the courage to turn back, and retrace
all these weary hundreds of miles down
the river.</p>

<p>And whenever Roger became silent it could
be taken for granted that he was allowing his
thoughts to roam in a certain direction; in
imagination picturing the happy day when he
and his cousin would reach the home settlement,
bringing with them, duly signed and witnessed,
the precious document that was to
bring such happiness to their loved ones.</p>

<p>The horses plodded on, with Dick keeping
a guiding hand on his bridle, and occasionally
glancing to the right, and to the left. Then he
would look upward, so as to get his bearings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from the position of the westering sun, which
was of course on their left now, and could only
be seen now and then, when there came a rift
in the timber.</p>

<p>They would soon be compelled to pick out a
camp site, for the day had almost reached its
close. Roger was sighing because they had
failed to reach the river, as he had fondly
hoped would be the case at the time they
started out that morning. And he was mentally
chiding himself for the twentieth time that
day, on account of having insisted on the experiment
of saving time by taking a “cut-off.”
No matter what the temptation might be, he
was determined never again to try and influence
Dick when the other thought differently
from him. Dick was a born guide. He always
figured things out accurately, and was seldom
if ever known to go amiss when leading the
expedition out of trouble; whereas he, Roger,
was a bungler and only fit to tag behind, ready
to assist.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had spoken a word for
nearly ten minutes. Roger was waiting to
hear his comrade say that they had better pull
up, and stop for the night. Much as he wished
to halt, and prepare supper, for he was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
hungry, he would not mention the fact to Dick,
being too proud to exhibit any weakness. And
the memory of how he had brought about all
this trouble hung like a heavy burden upon
Roger’s mind just then.</p>

<p>Around them the silence of the forest was
broken only by the chattering of little ground
squirrels, known to-day as chipmunks; or it
might be the scolding of the hasty tempered
blue jay in the branches of a cottonwood
tree.</p>

<p>When, therefore, a sound of an entirely different
nature struck upon the ears of the boys,
they were greatly startled. It was almost a
shriek, and both were of the impression that
it was a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>Their horses began to prance, as though the
unusual noise had given them a start, or else
from some other unseen cause.</p>

<p>These boys of the border had always been
brought up to be courteous to the other sex.
They would go far out of their way to render
aid to a woman or child in distress. And
therefore, when they heard what seemed to
them to be a cry of terror, and apparently in
a woman’s voice, the first thought of both was
to dig their heels into the sides of their horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and urge the beasts forward in the direction
whence the sound seemed to come.</p>

<p>It struck them as strange how unwilling the
animals seemed to be to advance; and this fact
caused Dick to entertain suspicions. Either
Indians were about, and the intelligent beasts
knew it, or else some sort of terrible wild animal
lurked among the thickets close by, and
had been scented by the horses.</p>

<p>But, under the urging of their masters, even
the horses had to give way, though it was evident
that they made the advance with reluctance.</p>

<p>And in this fashion, then, did they break
through the screen of bushes, so that they
stood upon the border of what seemed a forest
glade.</p>

<p>What they discovered there was a picture
neither of the lads would ever forget.</p>

<p>An old Indian squaw was brandishing a
heavy billet of wood, which she had evidently
hastily snatched up. Cowering under her protecting
arm was a little girl of perhaps seven
years of age—a pretty child, though undoubtedly
also an Indian.</p>

<p>And crouching on the limb of a nearby tree,
lashing its tail to and fro, as it worked itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
up into a rage in order to launch forth upon
its intended victims, was the largest gray
panther either of the boys had ever seen.</p>

<p>It had come upon the squaw and her helpless
charge suddenly, and, with the craftiness of its
kind, was holding back its final spring, just as
a domestic cat will allow a mouse to crawl
away before pouncing on it.</p>

<p>At any second now the terrible beast might
launch itself out, and crush the brave old
squaw under its weight.</p>

<p>It was impulsive Roger, always as quick as
lightning to act, who was the first to hurl himself
into action.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>CASTING BREAD UPON THE WATERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> presence of the panther so terrified the
horses that they kept up a continual prancing;
and it would have been next to impossible for
any one to have taken a sure aim while in the
saddle.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/i238.jpg" width="320" height="500" alt="small  cougar being shot from tree" />
<div class="caption">“WITH THE SHARP CRASH OF THE GUN THE GREAT GRAY BODY OF THE CROUCHING BEAST FLEW UPWARD.”</div>
</div>

<p>Roger understood this, for his first act was
to slip from his seat, gun in hand. His next
was to draw back the hammer of his rifle. It
was to be hoped that the powder lay properly
in the pan, so that there would be no false
flash.</p>

<p>Dick, too, had gripped his rifle, and was bent
on using it to the best of his ability in case his
comrade failed to kill the panther, though he
had confidence in the marksmanship of Roger.</p>

<p>The time could be measured only in seconds,
from Roger’s leaving his saddle to when he
pressed the trigger. And with the sharp crash
of the gun the great gray body of the crouching
beast flew upward, with all of its legs in
motion at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>It fell almost at the feet of the Indian squaw,
who drew back her charge, and at the same
time kept her stout cudgel ready, so as to make
use of it in case of necessity.</p>

<p>But there was no such need. Roger’s bullet
had done its work well; the ferocious beast
was already quivering in its death throes.</p>

<p>“Good shot, Roger!” cried the gratified
Dick, as he lowered his own gun.</p>

<p>The other was already reloading his long
rifle. That was a hunter’s instinct which had
been impressed so urgently on the minds of
these boys when mere striplings that they
could never neglect the precaution. An empty
gun is the nightmare of a wise hunter, for it
makes him worse than helpless.</p>

<p>Roger was making haste, wishing to be the
one to add the finishing touches in case anything
more was needed; but such did not
prove to be the case, for even as he completed
the task of reloading his weapon the animal
expired.</p>

<p>Dick was by now out of his saddle. He
found a place to hitch his horse by tossing the
bridle over a broken limb, caught the second
animal’s lines and did the same; after which
he turned for a look at the strange pair who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
had been saved from death, it might be,
through the coming of the white boys.</p>

<p>The squaw was not much different from all
of her kind, being wrinkled, and squat of figure
as one accustomed to bearing heavy loads, for
it is the women who do all the work in Indian
villages, while the braves hunt, and carry on
wars.</p>

<p>Evidently the squaw did not know whether
to look upon these strangers in the light of
friends or enemies. True, one of them had
saved her charge and herself from a terrible
fate; but then the white boys might decide to
make prisoners of them, and carry them far
away to their settlement.</p>

<p>She still gripped her cudgel, and her beady
black eyes flashed fire as Dick approached. He
saw that she was like a fox at bay, and ready
to meet him half way if he gave evidence of
wishing to do them harm.</p>

<p>So Dick, who had hastily slung his gun to
his back by means of the strap, held up both
his hands, palms extended toward the squaw.
That is the universal “peace sign,” recognized
all over the world, even among the blacks
of darkest Africa.</p>

<p>The wrinkled face of the squaw lost some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
its grimness. She even seemed to smile a
little, Dick thought; at any rate those fierce
black eyes glistened in a friendly way as she
nodded her head, and also held up both hands,
letting the club fall to the ground.</p>

<p>“Friends—no hurt squaw, pappoose.
How come here? Much bad job, panther.
Shake hands. Me Dick!”</p>

<p>Although it might have seemed a little comical,
the way the boy expressed himself, somehow,
either through her knowledge of a little
English, or because his gesture explained more
than his few words did, the squaw seemed to
understand him. She accepted his hand, and
her black eyes snapped some more when he
gave her fingers a friendly squeeze. Thus it
is possible for two people to communicate,
even when language fails.</p>

<p>“Me Karmeet, pappoose Dove Eyes. Prisoner
so long in Shoshone village. Get away.
Now on trail to lodges of Sioux. Much good
paleface boy, shoot big cat. Ugh!”</p>

<p>And that was about the extent of her willingness
to impart information. Whoever Karmeet
might be, she evidently had long ago been
taught that it was a woman’s place to hold her
tongue when any of the other sex were around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“We make camp, have meat to eat. Karmeet
hungry; Dove Eyes want food. You
much welcome join us. Stay all night in camp.
In morning go to Sioux wigwam. How?”</p>

<p>Dick in this way was trying to make the
squaw understand that they were about to halt
for the night, and camp; also that she and her
charge would be perfectly welcome to stay
there, and share in the supper of the white
boys.</p>

<p>Roger looked at the lined face to see whether
she understood, and immediately realized that
Dick knew how to go about it; for again she
nodded her head, looked anxiously at the girl,
and then muttered:</p>

<p>“We stay night with paleface boys. Much
good. Karmeet remember. Ugh!”</p>

<p>And so the two young pioneers went about
the duties of the hour as though they were
alone. They carefully selected the place where
the fire was to be made; and the keen eyes of
the squaw followed all their movements with
considerable curiosity. Roger, looking up
later, saw her nodding her head, and from this
he understood that she approved of their cunning
in thus providing against discovery of the
small blaze by hostile eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The horses were provided with a feeding
place, because there was grass in the forest
glade where the wandering Indian squaw and
her charge, in escaping from one peril, had almost
met their fate in another way.</p>

<p>Then supper was started. When Roger prepared
to cook the meat, to his amusement it
was taken from his hands by the old squaw,
who insisted on carrying out the rest of that
labor—though possibly the lads might have
preferred to do it their own way. But evidently
Karmeet had all her life been accustomed to
never seeing a warrior bending over the fire
whenever there was a squaw in the camp; they
might do the drudgery when out hunting, or
on the warpath, but never at home. That was
a woman’s duty.</p>

<p>There was plenty for all. Little Dove Eyes
had been visibly frightened at first sight of the
white boys, for doubtless they were the only
palefaces upon whom her eyes had ever rested.
But by degrees the smiles and nods of Roger
assured the child that he was a friend. Besides,
had not it been his “speaking-stick”
that had sent the terrible woods-cat to its
death, just when it seemed that nothing could
prevent it from springing on her guardian?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>And so by slow degrees she even tried to
talk with Roger, repeating after him the words
he uttered. He would pick up his weapon, and
say “gun” very distinctly; so in a little
while, when he asked her what it was, she
would say the word plainly, showing that the
lesson had been learned.</p>

<p>And so it was with other things, even to his
name, which proved pretty much of a stumbling-block;
for words of two syllables were
hard for the child to pronounce.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the evening passed, Dick
from time to time tried to engage the squaw in
conversation; but she was most uncommunicative,
for some reason or other, and answered
his questions either by shrugs that gave him to
believe she did not understand, or else by
single words.</p>

<p>But by dint of hard work he managed to get
enough information from her to understand
that she had been captured by a roving band
of Shoshones, then, as nearly always, at war
with the fighting Indians of the Northwest, the
fierce Sioux, and, together with the child, who
was related to her, carried away as captives
to one of their villages, where they had been
kept for months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally a chance came to make her escape,
though she would not go without Dove Eyes.
They had stolen two horses, which had carried
them many miles on their way toward the village
of her people. Then trouble came, for her
horse died of exhaustion, while that which the
little girl rode broke a leg by stepping in a
prairie dog hole.</p>

<p>After that they had gone afoot, existing as
best they could on berries and such things as
an Indian woman best knew would sustain life,
until, without warning, they had been confronted
by that hungry beast, which would
surely have pounced upon them had not the
paleface boys interfered.</p>

<p>Beyond that the squaw would not venture.
Just who and what she was Dick could not
ascertain, though once she did mention the
fact that the child’s father was a big chief
among her people.</p>

<p>And when it came time for seeking rest,
Roger willingly gave up his blanket in order
that their visitors might be provided with
some of the comforts to which their sex entitled
them.</p>

<p>As was customary, the boys kept a wary eye
out, though they had come to depend partly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
their horses to alarm them, should a creeping
Indian come near the camp during the night.
The animals seemed to fear the redskins as
much as any lonely settler’s wife might; and
would snort, and pound their hoofs upon the
ground, should they detect the presence of a
marauder.</p>

<p>Perhaps towards morning both of the boys
slept more soundly than usual, for they were
tired, and sleep is more apt to overpower a
watcher just before day comes on apace.</p>

<p>Roger was the first to get up. The earliest
peep of dawn could be seen in the far east,
through the trees, as he started to revive the
little fire in the cavity, so that they might have
an early breakfast, and move on. He found
himself hoping that this day might see them
once more looking out across the great river
they had followed so far.</p>

<p>Having managed to get the blaze started,
Roger turned to speak to his companion, to
find that Dick was already on his feet, and
looking around.</p>

<p>“Well, it happened just as I thought it
would,” Dick was saying.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded his companion,
wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look around, and tell me if you see our
visitors,” the other went on.</p>

<p>And Roger, turning his eyes in the quarter
where the squaw and her charge had been
lying, was astonished and dismayed to find
that they had disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE PICTURE WRITING ON THE BARK</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Why</span>, they’re gone!” the backwoods boy
exclaimed, as he stared hard at the spot where
he had supposed their visitors were still lying.</p>

<p>The blanket was there, carefully folded over
a stick of wood, so as to give the impression
at first glance that some one might be underneath,
though Roger now saw that this could
not be so.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a fact,” added Dick, just as if
he meant to say that any one with eyes could
see it.</p>

<p>“But, if you thought this would happen,
why didn’t we do something?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>Dick shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Why should we try to stop the old squaw
if she thought it best to leave us in this way?
She is naturally suspicious of all whites. And
perhaps, for all we know, she might have
thought we meant to take that little girl away
to our people. So, just like an Indian, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
watched her chance, and while we slept crept
out of camp. Let them go, Roger; even if we
wanted to, we couldn’t spare time to look for
them now. We have to find that river to-day,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you’re right, Dick,” admitted
the other, slowly, as he grasped the idea.
“And anyhow, she didn’t take my blanket. I
ought to be thankful for that, I suppose. Indians
are born thieves, they say. But see how
she wrapped it about this piece of wood, just
to make me think one of them might be lying
under the folds. What’s that lying on top of
the blanket, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Looks to me like a piece of fresh bark,”
replied the other, as he stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Oh! it may be a message!” cried Roger,
his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Just what it is,” answered his cousin.
“See, she has drawn it in pictures, for you
know that’s the only way Indians can communicate
their ideas to each other. Here is
what she means to stand for our camp, with
four of us sitting around a fire, two being men
and the others women, for they have skirts.
Then you can see the last two creeping away
on their hands and knees. And here they come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
into what I guess must be an Indian village.”</p>

<p>“How easy to understand what she wants
us to know,” declared Roger, much struck by
the manner in which the old squaw had left
word that she and the little Indian girl were
even then on their way to the village where
they belonged.</p>

<p>“I thought something like this might happen,”
Dick said, presently, “when I saw the
squaw hiding small pieces of meat last night,
instead of eating them herself, hungry though
she was. She meant to keep them for the child.
A warrior, or an old squaw, may be able to go
without a bite for days, but not a child.”</p>

<p>Roger folded his blanket, and stowed it
away, after which he went back to the little
blaze he had started, saying in a humorous
way:</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow we can have our meat
cooked as we want it this morning, and not
half burned in the Indian style; and that’s
worth something;” at which remark his comrade
laughed.</p>

<p>“The chances are we’ll never know just
who old Karmeet was, or the pretty little dark-faced
girl with her,” Roger observed later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
while they were eating their frugal meal.
“Dove Eyes, she said her name was; and perhaps
it was all right, though I never yet saw
a turtle-dove with such black eyes; did you,
Dick?”</p>

<p>But Dick’s mind was already wrestling with
a weightier problem. He had to map out the
day’s march and figure on whether they
would be apt to strike the river by still heading
due north. Roger was already questioning
in his mind whether they had not better turn
somewhat toward the northeast, so as to make
doubly sure; but as yet he had not dared
speak his thought aloud.</p>

<p>But after all, it looked as though these
things were ordered for the best. Supposing
they had never left the bank of the Missouri,
what would have been the fate of Karmeet and
little Dove Eyes? Surely there must be some
Power that regulated all such affairs; and
even this wandering on their part had been for
a purpose.</p>

<p>As they rode on that morning they gradually
left the timber behind once more, and found it
only in scattered <i>mottes</i>.</p>

<p>Roger was wavering in his belief, but Dick
never allowed himself to doubt that, sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
or later, they must come upon the river again,
and possibly many miles above the spot where
they had left it. He himself had been figuring
it out, and reached the conclusion that there
was a tremendous bend above the place of
their turning aside to make a “cut-off;” and
that, when they were able to again look upon
the current of the river, they would have saved
possibly a hundred miles of territory.</p>

<p>And should this prove to be the case Dick
stood ready to thank his companion for being
the cause of their wandering. What had promised
to be a disaster might under such new
conditions prove a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>At noon they halted only long enough to
take a cold bite. Indeed, this might as well
have been done while on the move, only that
the boys had compassion on their horses, and
wished to give them a little rest in the middle
of a hot day.</p>

<p>More than once Dick had raised himself in
the stirrups as the afternoon wore on. Roger
noticed this finally, and of course was curious
to know why he did it.</p>

<p>“Do you think you see anything ahead
there, Dick?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I was noticing the formation of the land,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
came the calm reply; “and, Roger, unless I’m
greatly mistaken, we’re going to come on the
river before the sun sets.”</p>

<p>“I only hope you’re a good prophet, Dick,
that’s all,” the other quickly returned, as he,
too, looked long and earnestly ahead. “And
now that you’ve called my attention to it, I do
believe it looks promising over there. Well,
for one, I’m fish hungry, and I don’t care who
knows it. It seems like a terribly long time
since I felt a fish tug at a line.”</p>

<p>What Dick so confidently predicted came
true.</p>

<p>Just one hour later they no longer had the
slightest doubt about the river lying ahead, for
there were many things that went to prove this
fact. Roger gave himself up to picturing the
success that was bound to follow his fishing
operations; for, as has been remarked, the
boy never was happier than when engaged in
his favorite occupation.</p>

<p>“If we don’t get there until about dark,
Dick, promise me that you’ll lay out our camp
to-night close to the water, so that I can have
my fill of fun without having to go far for it.
Seems to me I don’t want to lose sight of the
water in a hurry again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“I feel pretty much the same way as you
do, Roger,” replied the other, frankly. “And
so I can safely promise you what you ask.
We’ll sleep to-night so near the water that it
will make music to put us to sleep.”</p>

<p>“The finest of music, too,” ventured Roger;
“especially after you’ve been silly enough to
lose it for three nights running. But then I
keep on hoping we may have gained something
after all, which would make my blunder the
easier to hear.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that it will turn out to be so,”
added generous Dick.</p>

<p>“And that we are right now closer to the
exploring party than ever before; that would
be just fine, eh, Dick?”</p>

<p>“It certainly would, Roger. There, if you
look yonder, you can see the sun shining on
what can be nothing else than running water.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s what it must be, Dick; the
river at last! I’ll be glad to see our old friend
again. Two months we’ve been following its
course; until now we are so far away from
our homes that it almost seems as if we might
never get back there again. But it does look
good to see the water again, and to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
perhaps we’ll even have a taste of fresh fish
soon.”</p>

<p>Even the horses seemed to know that the
water was close by, for they acted as if given
new life, pushing on with a vim that had been
lacking during the earlier part of the day.</p>

<p>And so, about an hour before sundown, they
came upon the Missouri once more, flowing
peacefully between its wide banks, and at this
season of the year rather low; so that here
and there islands could be seen, as well as
sandbars, on the latter of which flocks of birds
sought their food.</p>

<p>“Now let’s find a good spot where we can
stay until morning; and it must be a fishing
place, too,” Roger remarked, as they turned
their horses’ heads up-stream.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he suddenly called out:</p>

<p>“Look! how would that little island do,
Dick? We can easily let the horses wade out,
because it is hardly to their knees, I feel sure.
And if you examine the lower part of the
island you’ll agree with me that it’s just the
finest place to let a baited hook float down-stream
anybody ever could find. Please say
yes, Dick!”</p>

<p>Roger was so urgent, and there seemed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
little chance of anything like disaster following
the move, that even cautions Dick could
not resist. And when they put the horses to
it, they found that the water, as Roger had
declared, was not more than a foot or so in
depth, so that the passage was easily accomplished.</p>

<p>It was only a small island, with a few trees
growing upon it, though even these showed
signs of having been compelled to fight for
existence when the spring freshets came along.</p>

<p>“We might as well make camp here at this
lower end, eh, Dick?” asked Roger, who had
an eye on the fishing possibilities, and was
anxious to get busy.</p>

<p>Dick had been looking around, as usual, being
desirous of getting the lay of the land
fixed in his mind in case there should come
any sudden necessity for a change of base
during the night, when he would know what to
do.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Roger,” he remarked.
“If we are going to camp here, one place is
about the same as another to me, so long as
we keep our fire well hidden. And I can see
where that can be easily done among these
rocks back here. The horses we can tie to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
trees with their ropes, and there is enough
grass to do for one night. So get busy as soon
as you wish. I’ll take care of everything
else.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dick; you feel for a fellow,
don’t you? But then you never were just as
wild for fishing as I am. Oh! don’t it seem
good to be back once more close to our old
friend, the river? And all night long I’m sure
the splash of the water on the rocks will keep
me sound asleep. It’s the next thing to getting
home again.”</p>

<p>And in a short time Roger was attending
to the several stout fish lines that he had
baited, and thrown far out upon the passing
current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>CAUGHT IN A RIVER TRAP</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Hurrah!</span> I’ve got one already, Dick! See
him pull, will you? Oh! this is worth waiting
for, I tell you. And now, I wonder what kind
it is, one of those slippery catfish, or the
strongly built buffalo fish. Whoo! he nearly
jerked the line out of my hands, then. But
he’s just got to come along. We want fish for
supper, don’t we, Dick?”</p>

<p>Calling out in this joyous strain Roger
pulled his line in, hand over hand, until he
finally landed his fish.</p>

<p>He did not stop work, but went at it again,
baiting his hook eagerly, although that one
capture ensured them all they wanted for a
single meal. And Dick, as soon as he was
through with the several little duties he had
taken upon himself, started to clean the fish.
Perhaps he, too, felt hungry for a change in
diet, since one type of food is bound to become
more or less monotonous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun had set, and night began to draw
near, as they started their small fire in the
secluded spot where even Dick declared there
was not a chance in the world for any passer-by
to discover it.</p>

<p>He had seen no sign of an Indian village up
or down the river, on either bank; but then, of
course, since they had come down to get upon
the island their range of vision was limited.</p>

<p>The supper was all that they had expected,
and as the fish was fried to a turn in the pan,
with some bear fat to keep it from sticking,
both boys enjoyed their meal about as well as
any they had eaten.</p>

<p>Afterwards Roger went back to his fishing,
for he had not thus far been lucky enough to
pull in a second captive; and the one they had
eaten tasted so fine he was of a mind to repeat
the programme for breakfast, if only he could
coax another victim to take hold.</p>

<p>As for Dick, he lay thinking of the thousand-and-one
things it was natural for a healthy
boy to have passing through his mind. Going
back, he could picture all the strange events
that had happened to them ever since that day
when they said good-by to the dear ones at
home, and, with their boyish hearts seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in their throats, urged their horses for the last
time over the well-worn trail leading to the
woods, where they had so often swung the axe,
and felled the trees in order to clear the land
for crops.</p>

<p>Finally, when after a long and tiresome
siege of it, Roger succeeded in landing a duplicate
of his first capture, the boy declared himself
satisfied. So he put away his fish lines,
and joined his companion.</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly like the looks of the sky,”
Dick remarked. “It was yellow at sunset, instead
of being red, as we like to see it.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean rain?” asked Roger;
though he knew it did, according to the way
frontiersmen looked at the signs of the
weather.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that was why I thought it just
as well to put our blankets in under that ledge
of rock. If the worst comes, we will have some
kind of shelter.”</p>

<p>“It was smart in you to think of that,
Dick,” declared the other; “but, then, I’m so
used to having you do the right thing that I’d
have been surprised if you let a chance go by
for getting some sort of a roof over our
heads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>But at the time they settled themselves
down for the night, taking advantage of the
rocky cover, no rain had fallen, and Roger expressed
his hope that it might after all prove
a false alarm.</p>

<p>Hours later the boys were awakened by a
crash of thunder, and the first thing that
greeted them when they sat up in their limited
quarters was the sweep of the rising wind
through the trees.</p>

<p>“It’s coming, after all, Dick!” cried out
Roger, in a disappointed tone.</p>

<p>“Looks like we might be in for it,” replied
the other.</p>

<p>“Can we do anything?” demanded Roger,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m going out to make sure the horses are
fast before we have the rain pouring down on
us,” said Dick, starting to crawl from under
the rocky roof.</p>

<p>“But, Dick, what if the river should rise,
and cover this island; don’t you think we’d
better be getting ashore?” called out Roger.</p>

<p>“It’s too late to try that now, for I can hear
the rain coming down the river, and we’d be
right in the worst of the storm. Stay where
you are, Roger; I’ll be back in a jiffy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick may not have known just what a
“jiffy” was, but he certainly made pretty
quick time of it, after finding that the horses
were standing under the cottonwood trees,
with their tails toward the coming storm, as
horses, and indeed all animals of their type,
are wont to do.</p>

<p>“Whew! it’s right on us; and such a roar
as the wind and rain make, as they come rushing
down the river,” Dick said, as he crawled
once more under the rocky roof, and joined
his anxious companion.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’m glad we can swim,” Roger
remarked, showing that he was still thinking
of a possible flood, and the fact that their position
on the island placed them in a serious predicament
in case the river rose rapidly, so as
to cover the highest point, which was not many
feet above the spot where they had camped.</p>

<p>There was really no time for further exchange
of words. With a rush and a roar that
were appalling, the storm burst upon them.
They could hear the rain beating down in torrents,
while the thunder crashed until the
island seemed to shake under the heavy reverberations,
and the lightning kept up a constant
flashing that dazzled their eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet there was a sort of fascination
about the play of the storm that riveted their
attention, so that they could not drag their
eyes away, but, crouching there, continued to
gaze, spell-bound.</p>

<p>Both boys thought more than once how fortunate
it was that the rocky ledge under which
they had found shelter for their bodies, as well
as their few belongings, chanced to face in an
opposite direction from that in which the
storm was coming.</p>

<p>Had it been otherwise they must have been
drenched to the skin; for the driving wind
would have sent the heavy sheets of falling
rain far under their cover.</p>

<p>They knew not what time of night it was,
for not a star could be seen in that black
sky.</p>

<p>“Will it ever stop?” shouted Roger, when
there was finally a little lull in the wild racket—at
least enough to admit of his voice reaching
the ears of his comrade, close at hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s bound to,” replied Dick, being
wiser, for he placed his lips close to the ear of
his cousin; “but already it seems to me the
river is rising. I can surely hear the noise of
it rushing along between us and the shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>His words of course caused Roger more or
less uneasiness, for he had himself been
haunted latterly with visions of what a terrible
thing it might prove for them if their escape
should be cut off by morning, and the
flood even threaten to wipe the island out of
existence.</p>

<p>They could do nothing to better their condition,
since it was now too late to think of
trying to make the mainland. Their horses
would prove unmanageable, with all that lightning
to frighten them; and the chances were
disaster must follow any attempt to ford the
swollen stream before dawn came to show
them just what perils they had to face.</p>

<p>That was surely a night never to be forgotten
by the boys. And the longer it kept up,
the greater grew their apprehension. Indeed,
numbers of times Roger even loudly protested
that he could feel the water coming into their
shelter, though happily enough it proved every
time that this was only some trickling rivulet,
caused by a temporary shift of wind, and not
an invasion by the encroaching river.</p>

<p>“Will daylight ever come?” he kept saying,
time and again; for it was the utter darkness
more than anything else that appalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
them, with the storm beating down steadily,
and the river rising all the while.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about this, for
whenever the wind ceased for a brief interval,
and the growling of the thunder died away,
they heard that rushing sound, such as could
only be made by great volumes of water speeding
along.</p>

<p>Once Dick attempted to sally forth in order
to learn just how matters stood, and whether
the poor horses were enduring the downpour
all right; but he did not get very far away,
because another rush of rain caused him to
dodge back to shelter.</p>

<p>Roger even dozed a little, being more or less
accustomed to the noise by this time. But he
was electrified to hear Dick suddenly call out:</p>

<p>“I really believe it’s getting lighter, because
I can see things out there that I couldn’t
a while ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right, Dick!” exclaimed the
other, as he thrust his head out; “and let me
tell you, for one, I’m not sorry that day’s coming.
When there’s anything wrong I like to
see what I have to meet. This thing of being
left in the dark gives me a cold shiver. See,
it’s getting lighter every minute. Oh! look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the river, will you? It doesn’t seem like the
same one we fished in last night.”</p>

<p>Nor did it, for the heavy rain must have
fallen all along the stream, which was rising
very fast, and was likely to continue to do so
for several hours to come. A flood at this late
summer day was doubtless a rare occurrence;
but, then, the Missouri has always been known
to do the least expected of things, so, with
such a cloudburst to help along, even that was
liable to happen.</p>

<p>“But thank goodness the rain seems to
have stopped, even if the clouds are still hanging
overhead,” Roger declared, as he drew his
stiffened figure from under the overhanging
ledge, and tried to straighten up.</p>

<p>Then the two went, first of all, to see if the
horses were there, and to their satisfaction
found the poor beasts standing under a tree,
as wet as they could possibly be, but apparently
not otherwise harmed by the storm.</p>

<p>Afterwards they turned to survey the
raging flood.</p>

<p>Between the island and the shore, where the
horses had easily waded, there now rushed a
torrent that must have been over their heads,
and so fierce that even the hardiest swimmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
could never have held his own against its
power.</p>

<p>“That’s bad enough,” admitted Roger;
“but just see how the water is still creeping
up on us. It looks to me as if the whole island
would soon be covered!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE RISING WATERS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> <i>is</i> rising, Roger,” admitted the older
boy, seriously, as he surveyed the tumbling
waters, rushing along with a noise like the
churning of a score of grist mills, such as the
one near the St. Louis settlement.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will keep on increasing all
day, Dick?” asked the other, with a ring of
alarm in his voice.</p>

<p>“It may,” was the reply. “That will depend
on how far up the river that heavy rainfall
extended. If it covered the whole watershed,
then the river here must keep on getting
bigger for a good many hours before it
reaches a crest.”</p>

<p>“But we never knew the Missouri to rise
at this late time in the summer, did we,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Not anything like this, that’s sure, Roger.
Of course, after a heavy storm it always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
creeps up. But this is really a flood, and will
bother the exploring expedition for a day or
two, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but they have boats, and will think
little or nothing of it, Dick,” the younger boy
went on. “But what a bad fix it finds us in!
What if the water does keep on coming up and
up all day; won’t it cover this little island
and perhaps wash it away?”</p>

<p>“Oh! hardly that,” Dick hastened to answer.
“It has stood many floods in the spring
time, because these trees have had a chance to
grow.”</p>

<p>“But even if that rushing water only
covers the island, where will we be then, I’d
like to know? Ugh! it makes me shiver to
think of it,” and Roger turned to look once
more at the roaring river.</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t know where we’ll be,”
Dick observed, calmly; “but if we’ve got the
good sense I think we have, chances are two
boys about our size will be perched in the
branches of the largest tree on the island, with
all their stores about them, waiting for the
waters to go down again.”</p>

<p>“Oh! and I never thought of that, either!”
exclaimed Roger, apparently somewhat relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in his mind, as he noted that one of the
trees was of some size.</p>

<p>“The worst thing about that plan,” continued
Dick, “is that we’ve got to lose our
horses; and I hate to think of that more than
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Will they be drowned, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Well, horses can swim, you know; and
they might get ashore if we turned them loose
in good time. But even then, we’d never be
able to track them; and our job of overtaking
the expedition would be made all the harder.
Still, we will not be the ones to give it up,
Roger. Nothing could make us do that, could
it?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, it could not,” replied the
other boy, firmly. “But, Dick—”</p>

<p>“Yes, what idea has come into your mind
now?” asked the other lad, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Why, when you spoke of turning the
horses loose, and letting them have a chance
of reaching the shore, I thought what a fine
thing it would be if we were holding on to the
saddles at that time. Why, they’d just tow
us to land with them, you see!”</p>

<p>“Yes, if they got there, which isn’t a sure
thing at all,” replied Dick. “But we will decide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
all that later on. Perhaps the river will
rise only a little more, and then come to a
stand-still. And, in case of the worst, we’ve
always got that tree there. Even if it should
be undermined by the flood, and carried away,
we might stick in the branches.”</p>

<p>“And float down the river, you mean,”
added Roger. “That would save our lives,
of course; but think how we’d feel, going
away from Captain Lewis mile after mile.
Why, this makes me think of what our fathers
told us about that flood up along the Ohio, that
was the cause of their coming further West.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“That’s a fact, it does; and they came near
being drowned in that same flood, too, didn’t
they?” said Dick. “But let’s begin to get
our packages ready, in case we have to climb
this tree. It’s just as well to be prepared,
even if we never have to carry out that plan.”</p>

<p>“But you really think we will have to, don’t
you, Dick?” persisted the other.</p>

<p>“If the water gets high enough to cover our
island, yes,” was the reply; “because there’s
really no other way. But these summer floods
come and go quickly. It isn’t like the early
spring time, when the ground is frozen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the downpour can find no way to soak into it,
so that it all rushes off.”</p>

<p>Dick was a good fellow to have along on an
occasion of this kind. He always managed to
appear cheerful, no matter how seriously the
conditions affected him; and besides this, he
was so very fertile in resource. Seldom did
there arise a sudden emergency but that Dick
proved himself capable of suggesting an immediate
remedy. In this particular he resembled
his father, Bob Armstrong, who, in the old
days on the Ohio, used to be looked up to by
his younger brother, Sandy, on this account.</p>

<p>It was far from cheerful work, however,
standing there keeping track of the gradual
rise of the river. And it lacked the interest
that they might have found in the task had
they been at home, and only curious to know
what height the water would reach before
starting to as speedily decline.</p>

<p>Now they had everything at stake; and it
meant great peril to them if the little island
should be completely submerged.</p>

<p>Roger had constructed a contrivance
whereby they were able to know just how
fast the water rose. This was a stick which
he had marked off in inches, and driven into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the ground at the edge of the river. By consulting
it every little while they were enabled
to learn the truth, and it was a continued disappointment.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we’d have to climb, sooner or
later, Dick,” declared Roger, when several
hours had passed, and they had three times
been forced to retreat before the advance of
the flood, removing their “tally stick” on
each occasion.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say it’s getting that way,”
replied the other, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“But what about the horses?” demanded
Roger.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got them here by the tree,
and when we have to mount up among the
branches we can turn them loose,” answered
his cousin.</p>

<p>“But, Dick, if they have to go, poor things,
why make it harder for them?”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean, Roger; you think
we ought to cut the ropes now, and let them
swim for the shore. It does you credit, too;
but I hardly believe it would work.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t it?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“For this reason,” came the reply.
“Horses are affectionate. They get accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to people, and these ones know us well,
because we’ve raised them from colts. Now,
the chances are that, if we turned them loose
at this minute, they would refuse to leave us
until the water forced them to swim. Even if
you pushed one off the island, I feel sure he
would try hard to get back again. So what’s
the use of turning them loose now?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s so,” admitted Roger. “I
was only thinking of giving the poor beasts a
better chance to get ashore; because the
higher the water rises the harder it will be for
them to swim.”</p>

<p>After that they stood watching and waiting;
but with only the most dismal forebodings as
to what was to come. And indeed it was anything
but pleasant to think of being made prisoners
in a tree that would be completely surrounded
by a raging flood, perhaps for
another night and day. And then the loss of
their horses was going to make their task of
overtaking the expedition all the harder.</p>

<p>So the morning passed, and while on several
occasions Roger indulged in new hopes that
the water had come to a stand at last, these
were only fated to be dashed to the ground on
his next anxious inspection of his “tally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
stick,” when he learned that the flood was
actually making up for lost time.</p>

<p>“How much longer will we have, Dick?”
he asked, when, for the third time, he had
made this unpleasant discovery.</p>

<p>“At the rate it seems to be crawling up our
stake, it will only be two hours until the water
will be at the foot of this tree,” replied the
other, who had already figured all this out.</p>

<p>“Two hours isn’t much time, is it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the other, with a smile,
“that all depends on the conditions. You can
look back to lots of times when it would seem
like an eternity. Remember that night when
you slipped and fell over that precipice, just
managing to get hold of a bush, and holding
on while you shouted for me to come and help
you up, because you couldn’t do anything
yourself? If you’d had to hang there, kicking
your heels in space, two hours, instead of ten
minutes, I think they’d have seemed the longest
you ever knew.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Roger, smiling a
little himself at the scene which his comrade’s
words recalled. “And just as you say, Dick,
we have been through a good many hard
scrapes together, haven’t we; and always, up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to now, managed to come out on top? Perhaps
we’ll do the same this time, too.”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure we will,” declared the
other, stoutly, “don’t let any other notion get
hold of you, Roger. It’s all bound to come out
right; haven’t we been told that many times
by our mothers, when things looked a little
black—and didn’t the sky clear every time?
We’ll escape from this island, overtake the expedition,
get that paper signed by Jasper
Williams, and bring joy to all our dear ones at
home. Why, I’m just as sure of that, Roger,
as that we’re standing here right now, wondering
how we’re going to get ashore. But a
way will be provided, mark my words.”</p>

<p>Never was a prophecy more speedily fulfilled.
Hardly had five minutes passed than
Roger clutched the sleeve of his cousin’s tunic,
and in a voice that trembled with emotion,
burst out:</p>

<p>“Look! oh! look, Dick, are my eyes going
back on me—is this one of those mirages they
told us we would meet with on the prairies;
or is that really a boat—yes, two, <i>three</i> of
them—down at the bend below, and working
up against even all this fierce current? Three
boats, Dick—wasn’t that what Captain Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had with him when he started away from St.
Louis? Oh! speak and tell me if I am going
out of my mind, and seeing things that I’ve
been dreaming about so long!”</p>

<p>Dick laughed, and hugged his cousin with
rapture.</p>

<p>“No, no, Roger, your eyes are all right,
and the boats are there!” he cried. “We’ve
only managed to get <i>ahead</i> of the expedition,
that’s all. And we’ll be saved now, Roger!
We’ve won out at last!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> that neither of the boys could utter a
word for a time. They just stood there, trembling
with emotion, and staring at the moving
figures down the river.</p>

<p>Then, as if by agreement, they turned and
faced each other. Dick thrust out his hand
impulsively, and it was instantly seized by his
cousin. Indeed, Roger looked as though he
could hardly restrain himself from throwing
his arms about the neck of his companion, so
greatly was he overcome; but probably the
conviction that such an act, however natural,
would seem weak and childish, restrained him.
Boys in those days had so much responsibility
placed upon their young shoulders that they
had to call themselves men long before they
reached the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>By degrees they became somewhat calmer,
and could even speak once more without betraying
their emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re making headway against even
that powerful current, don’t you see, Dick?”
was what Roger remarked, as though something
in the occurrence pleased him.</p>

<p>“Yes, it would have to be greater difficulties
than that to keep those determined men from
pushing forward,” observed Dick, in turn.
“They have overcome everything that has
cropped up to try and discourage them, up to
now. And with such a leader as Captain
Lewis, they are bound to cross all the way to
the ocean.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see that, if they can breast
that current, they will be able to get us off this
island trap?” continued Roger.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that,” answered the other;
“and now, Roger, let’s signal to them, for as
yet they don’t seem to have noticed us standing
here.”</p>

<p>“Then they’re due for the greatest surprise
of the whole trip,” chuckled Roger. “It must
be the last thing they’d ever think to see, a
couple of white boys further up the river than
they’ve come after all these months. Say
when you’re ready, Dick, and we’ll call out
hello!”</p>

<p>“Let it be now, then,” replied his comrade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Together they sent out lusty hails, forming
their hands into cups that would answer the
purpose of a megaphone, though neither
Roger nor Dick had ever seen such a thing,
since it was utterly unknown at that day.</p>

<p>And indeed, when the sound of their voices
reached the plucky explorers, there seemed to
ensue something like a small panic.</p>

<p>Some of the men were seen to jump for their
firearms, doubtless under the impression that
they were about to be attacked by a strolling
band of the fierce Sioux, always striving to be
the lords of the northwest prairies.</p>

<p>Then they apparently discovered that the
two on the little island amidst the swirling
waters of the flood were white boys, and that
they were beckoning wildly, as though trying
to let the exploring party know they needed
help.</p>

<p>After that some of the men hurried up the
shore so as to sooner reach a point opposite
the island. Among them the prisoners of the
flood recognized the figure of Captain Lewis,
himself; for they had seen him talking to
others in St. Louis early in the spring, before
the expedition started.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and how did you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
there?” demanded the leader of the party,
also using his hands in order to make
his voice carry above the roar of the
current.</p>

<p>“We come from St. Louis, and have been
trying to overtake you!” replied Dick.</p>

<p>“I hope it is nothing serious; do you come
with a message for me from the President?
I trust he has not seen fit to recall the expedition,
and abandon the plan for exploring the
Great Northwest country?” the captain
shouted next, doubtless a prey to many anxieties.</p>

<p>“No,” called out the boy; “we are only
up here on private business connected with one
who is among your number. We lost the river,
and wandered several days; but, when we
struck it again at this point, we must have
gained enough to place us ahead. We have
horses, and camped on this island when the
water was low; but the storm came and
trapped us. Do you think you can get us off,
Captain Lewis?”</p>

<p>“Without a doubt we can,” the other answered,
heartily, “and will very shortly, when
the boats get up this far. Have no anxiety on
that score, friends. But you seem to be only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
boys; is it possible that two such youths could
make this long journey, and escape all the
perils that lie in wait for white travelers in
this region?”</p>

<p>“We have been very fortunate,” was Dick’s
modest reply.</p>

<p>“Ah! you have been more than fortunate!”
cried Captain Lewis, admiration in
his tones; “and I shall be very proud to take
you both by the hand. It is wonderful how
you pioneer boys are built; nothing seems to
daunt you. No wonder that some of the men
with me are so ready to accept any hazards,
when they spring from such stock as that.
Have patience, lads, and we will soon be able
to reach you.”</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had any longer the
slightest doubt that their rescue was as good
as accomplished. When such dauntless men
set about doing anything they would not let
difficulties stand in the way.</p>

<p>So, standing there, they watched with considerable
interest as the boats were forced
against that apparently resistless current of
the swollen Missouri. At times stout poles
were resorted to; and, when a particularly bad
bend was to be negotiated, ropes came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
play in order to warp the craft around the
point where the water flowed swiftest.</p>

<p>In this fashion they would be able to make
quite a number of miles during the course of a
day, and every one counted as so much gained.</p>

<p>When finally the entire expedition had
reached a point opposite to the island, they
came to a halt, and preparations for the release
of the prisoners were instituted.</p>

<p>A giant, carrying the end of a rope,
plunged recklessly into the river above the
upper end of the island, and battled with the
current. He was of course swept down the
stream, in spite of his sturdy efforts, but it
appeared that he had calculated well, for he
reached the shore of the island, and was able
to crawl up the bank.</p>

<p>Then the rope was fastened to a tree, and
those on the mainland drew it taut, so that it
only dipped in the center into the water.</p>

<p>Under the directions of this experienced
frontiersman, who turned out to be one of the
Kentuckians forming a part of the expedition,
the horses were one after the other started for
the shore. A traveling ring on the rope was
used to secure their stout rope bridles, and,
once they were forced to plunge into the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and kept from returning to the island, the intelligent
animals seemed to understand what
was required of them, and struck out for the
mainland.</p>

<p>The rope served to keep them from being
swept down-stream, so that in the end they
emerged from the water, and shook themselves
like dogs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boys had prepared for the
passage, taking off a part of their garments,
and making them into compact bundles, that
were to be carried with their other few possessions
remaining; for most of them had
been attached to the horses, and were already
safe ashore, awaiting their coming.</p>

<p>Dick insisted on going first, for he wanted
Roger to observe what he meant to do, so that
the more impetuous boy might pattern by his
example. But Roger came close behind, since
the rope was amply able to bear a double
strain.</p>

<p>For a short time it was pretty exciting work,
since the current was swift, and seemed to tear
at them, as though determined not to be
cheated out of its prey. But the boys had no
difficulty in keeping hold of the rope, and thus
hitching themselves along, a foot at a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">“CAPTAIN LEWIS AND CAPTAIN CLARK ... WERE PLEASED TO WELCOME DICK AND ROGER.”</div>
</div>

<p>Once past the middle of that portion of the
river lying between the island and the shore,
the worst was over; and every rod gained now
meant an easier time, so that presently eager
hands were outstretched to help them up the
bank.</p>

<p>A shout that might have been heard far
away attested the deep interest soldiers and
frontiersmen had taken in the rescue. Every
man came crowding up to squeeze the hands
of the two lads, and declare that he was proud
to welcome them to the ranks of the expedition.
After all these weary weeks of battling
with the current of the great river, and meeting
every imaginable kind of danger and difficulty,
it was like a breath from home to thus
come upon two valiant young fellows, away
up here in the land of the fighting Sioux.</p>

<p>It seemed almost incredible to think of mere
boys capable of accomplishing such a task.
No wonder both Captain Lewis and Captain
Clark, his capable fellow commander, were
pleased to welcome Dick and Roger.</p>

<p>“It seems to me I have seen you both before,”
remarked the former. “It must have
been in the settlement of St. Louis, while we
were arranging the details of our long trip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and waiting for some of the men to arrive.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dick, “it was there, and
you met our fathers, the Armstrong brothers,
sons of old David Armstrong, who came from
Virginia, settled on the Ohio, and finally made
his way down the river to the Mississippi, acting
under the advice of Daniel Boone, who was
his life-long friend.”</p>

<p>“Now I remember you,” responded Captain
Lewis. “Which one of you caught my
runaway horse before he got fairly started?
It was a quick action; and I believe I thanked
whoever it was on the spot, and shook hands
with the lad.”</p>

<p>“That was Roger, here, Captain Lewis!”
declared Dick quickly, only too glad of the
opportunity to bring his cousin into the light.</p>

<p>“But both of you are shivering with the
cold, after getting wet,” remarked the soldier
captain, William Clark. “See, some of my
men have started fires, for we intend to cook
our noonday meal at this spot. Go over there
and keep warm, while some of us dry your
garments. This has been the happiest event
of the whole trip. Only it was a little unwise
for you to camp on that island, when a storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
threatened. The Missouri is a freakish
stream, and you have to watch it closely, or it
will catch you napping some time.”</p>

<p>“That was all my fault, Captain,” admitted
Roger, frankly. “I am wild for fishing, and
begged my cousin to cross over and camp
there, so that I could watch my lines close to
our little cooking fire. And while he gave in
to me, I could see that it was really against his
better judgment. But we were the luckiest fellows
going to get out of the trap so easily.
And we are happy to know that, after our
long chase, we have caught up with you at
last.”</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had as yet ventured to
say anything regarding the nature of their
mission. That would come later, when they
found a better opportunity to chat with the
genial leaders. And the advice given by the
soldier was worth following, because, of a
truth, they were both shivering with the coolness
of the air after the storm, since the few
garments they had on were thoroughly soaked.</p>

<p>It was a bustling scene that the boys looked
on as they sat close to the fire, drying their
clothes. How different things would be now,
when they no longer had any reason to hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
their fire. A force of twenty-one regular soldiers,
as well as an equal number of young
Kentuckians and frontiersmen, who acted as
scouts and hunters, in order to supply fresh
meat to the expedition, had little fear of the
Indians.</p>

<p>Besides, their boats were arranged to be of
more or less value to them as places of refuge
in case of an attack, one of them being covered
over, and capable of serving as no mean fortress,
from behind whose walls they could pour
their fire into the lines of any attacking
force.</p>

<p>By the time a hot dinner had been cooked
the boys were once more feeling comfortable,
since their garments were all well dried. They
sat down with the two comrades, as their
especial guests, and it became apparent that
Captain Lewis in particular had been much
taken with both Dick and Roger.</p>

<p>As they ate and talked Captain Lewis
finally introduced the subject that had been
puzzling him so long.</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling us what caused
you to take this daring journey, my lads?” he
asked, with a kindly smile.</p>

<p>“An enemy of our fathers,” Dick went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to explain, “one François Lascelles, has managed
in some way to secure a hold upon the
property which was secured by our grandfather
from the original French settlers above
St. Louis, and threatens to take it away from
them. His claim is undoubtedly a false one;
but, unless we can secure the signature of a
certain party to a paper we carry, it is certain
that the entire valuable tract of land will be
taken from our parents by spring, at the latest.
Too late, it was learned that this man had
agreed to join your force somewhere on the
way. We started out after you had been gone
for weeks; but, as we had good horses, and
you had your boats to force up the river, we
gradually came up on you, until now we have
arrived.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen the one you are seeking
among the men here?” asked the commander.</p>

<p>“We do not know him by sight, but his
name is Jasper Williams,” replied Roger.</p>

<p>The face of Captain Lewis clouded.</p>

<p>“I am indeed sorry to hear that,” he said;
“because only two days ago I sent Jasper
Williams, whom I count as my best scout, to go
on ahead, and make friends with the Mandan
Indians, whose hunting grounds we will be approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in a few weeks, and with whom I
may determine to remain all winter. So that
you will have to keep on with us until we can
come up on him once more!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE VILLAGE OF THE MANDANS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">That’s</span> a bitter disappointment, Captain
Lewis,” declared Dick, when he could speak
clearly, after gulping down the lump that
arose in his throat.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can well understand that it must
seem so, after all the adventures and hardships
you have met with in order to overtake
us,” replied the genial leader of the exploring
party; “but, then, what is to hinder you from
accompanying us as far as the Mandan country,
where we will undoubtedly come upon
Williams again, and you can induce him to
affix his signature to the document? Indeed,
both Captain Clark and myself will only too
gladly witness it, if that would please you.”</p>

<p>Dick looked at Roger, and the latter smiled,
although a moment before he had felt the bitter
tears of disappointment welling into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“It is the only thing we can do, Roger!”</p>

<p>“And, after all, what could be nicer, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
it will give us a chance to be in the company
of Captains Lewis and Clark for many days,”
the other rejoined, as though he had seen the
sun gleam through the rain clouds.</p>

<p>“And,” the commander continued, encouragingly,
“after we have decided where we
shall spend the winter, somewhere near the
Mandan village, so as to undertake the scaling
of the mountains when spring comes again,
we may be sending a couple of scouts back
down the river with a message to the President,
to inform him of what success we have met
with thus far, since he will be anxious to know.
If you choose, you can accompany that party;
or, if you would rather remain with us, entrust
one of them—a reliable man he shall be—with
your valuable document, to be delivered,
on my word of honor, to your grandfather
on their reaching St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>That was all Roger said, but the light that
flashed across his eager, boyish face baffled
description. What Captain Lewis had just
said amounted to an invitation to join the exploring
force, and be a member of the expedition
that was bound to go down in history as
famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>And perhaps quiet, sober Dick experienced
some of the same enthusiasm, although he was
better able to restrain his feelings. The prospect
of being in the company of these hardy
souls for days, and perhaps weeks, was a
pleasant one; and, if that pleasure were extended
to the entire winter and following summer,
it would be the greatest event of their
lives.</p>

<p>Dick realized that, having said as much as
he had, it was only right that he should go into
more details concerning the scheme of the
French trader to legally cheat them out of
their homes.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he told all that he knew about
it, both of the commanders listening with considerable
interest, and expressing their sympathy
with the settlers.</p>

<p>“I have heard of this Lascelles,” remarked
Captain Lewis, “and nothing to his credit,
either. He is certainly a rascal. It is a pity
the law cannot reach such as he; but his cunning
always keeps him from putting his neck
in the rope. But some fine day he is certain to
meet his fate at the hands of some furious
frontiersman whom he has cheated. I understand
that, years ago, he used to be a trapper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and by degrees changed into a buyer of pelts,
and a rich trader.”</p>

<p>“I have met him many times,” said Captain
Clark, “and never liked the man. He is one
of those blustering bullies, who believes he can
frighten others by a black frown, and hard
words.”</p>

<p>When the expedition once more started, the
boys were looked upon as members of the
party. They had a most delightful afternoon,
vastly different from the distress and gloom
of the earlier part of the day.</p>

<p>All that was done they watched with considerable
interest, learning how these expert
French Canadian watermen managed, in order
to cope with the swift current of the river at
its worst stage.</p>

<p>It was agreed by all that the flood would
subside almost as quickly as it had come, and
that inside of two days the river would probably
be at about the same level as before.
Still, as it kept on rising for the balance of the
afternoon, Dick was of the opinion that the
island must have been fully covered, which,
had they remained there, would have necessitated
their climbing the tree, in order to keep
from being swept away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>They were bubbling over with delight at
their improved prospects.</p>

<p>“I’ll always believe in that old saying about
its being ‘darkest just before dawn,’” Roger
remarked, as they rode on ahead of the rest
of the party, though there were always a few
scouts far in the van to look for signs of hostile
Indians, who might be trying to lay some
sort of ambush, with the design of sending a
shower of arrows among the whites.</p>

<p>“Who are these Mandan Indians the captain
was telling us about, Dick?” asked the
younger boy, while they rode together late in
the afternoon, with a fair sky overhead, and a
brisk breeze blowing that seemed to hint of the
autumn season not so far away.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard some talk about them,” replied
Dick; “and people say they are different from
all the other tribes up here. Some call them
the white Indians, because they seem to be less
of a coppery hue than the rest. And they have
many queer customs, which we may see for
ourselves—if we have to stick by the expedition
that long, at least.” (<a id="Note_5r"></a><a href="#Note_5">Note 5</a>.)</p>

<p>“‘At least!’” echoed Roger, meaningly;
“that sounds as if you might be thinking of
accepting Captain Lewis’s invitation to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
members of the expedition, and go all the
way with him to the Western ocean.”</p>

<p>Dick sighed.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I am tempted to say I’d like
nothing better, if we could be positive that the
paper, that is going to save our parents’
homes, was sure of reaching the hands of
Grandfather Armstrong. Then again, a longing
to see my mother and father and Sam
will grip me, and shake that temptation
off.”</p>

<p>“It is the same with me, Dick; and, yet,
just think what a glorious chance we have to
see wonderful things. It will never come to us
again; and perhaps our parents would think we
were foolish not to take advantage of it now.
Of course I never would dream of such a thing,
if we couldn’t get that paper home to them;
but Captain Lewis assured us it would go just
as safely with his messengers as though we
carried it ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so, Roger; and we’ll talk it
over,” Dick went on hastily. “Surely we
shall have plenty of time for that as the days
pass by. And, if we can see our way clear to
do it honorably, without feeling that we are
wrong, perhaps—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will say stay?” exclaimed the other,
joyfully.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” was the only satisfaction
Dick would give his impetuous companion;
but Roger knew that the seed had been
planted, and he had reason to believe it must
germinate in good season, if all went well.</p>

<p>Then came the camp, as evening approached.</p>

<p>How different it all was to what they had
been used to doing. There was apparently no
reason for concealment. The fires blazed
brightly and cheerfully, and the preparations
for cooking the evening meal were gone about
in a manner quite the opposite to what they
had become accustomed to; the men laughing
and chatting as they hovered around the several
fires, while sentries, posted by Captain
Clark to ensure against any surprise, stood
their posts, grim and faithful.</p>

<p>One of the voyageurs, a man named Fields,
seemed to be particularly interested in the two
lads, and they learned the reason why when
they came to chat with him later in the evening,
sitting beside a fire.</p>

<p>“I knew Pat O’Mara,” he told them, “and
often heard him tell about your fathers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
were to him Bob and Sandy Armstrong. I
also knew Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton in
the days gone by, for I have roamed over all
the country between the Great Lakes and Kentucky.
And it pleases me to think that I’ve
run across the sons of those pioneers who
came down the Ohio River when its banks
were lined with savage Shawanees, Delawares
and other red foes, waiting for a chance to surprise
settlers, and lift their scalps.”</p>

<p>Fields, whose name will be found written on
the scroll of fame as a member of that wonderful
little party, was a man of more than ordinary
intelligence, and both Dick and Roger
came to be very fond of him in the long days
that followed, as they continued to press on,
always into the northwest, with the river
gradually becoming smaller the farther they
advanced toward its unknown source.</p>

<p>The two Armstrong boys were not willing
to simply act as guests, and accept favors.
They wanted to do their part toward supplying
the expedition with fresh meat while in
company with those who had been so kind to
them.</p>

<p>So from time to time they went out, generally
in the company of some older hunter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
like Fields, to look for buffalo, elk, antelope
or any other kind of game. And, as had usually
been the case in their hunts, the boys were
lucky in finding plenty of game; so that before
long they began to be looked on as the
main source of fresh meat supply for the
camp.</p>

<p>They met with more or less adventure while
engaged in this work; but nothing of a really
serious nature came along. Nor were they so
unfortunate as to run across hostile Indians,
though constantly warned to keep a sharp
lookout for signs of the treacherous Sioux,
who were feared more than any of the other
tribes along the upper reaches of the “Big
Muddy,” as the Missouri came to be called
even in those early days, on account of the
condition of its turgid waters.</p>

<p>Another thing Dick and Roger bore in mind,
and this was the possible presence of the
French trader, François Lascelles, and his son
Alexis in the neighborhood. Not a thing had
they heard concerning this pair since leaving
St. Louis, and secretly Dick was hoping that
they had been turned back by the innumerable
obstacles they must have met with soon after
starting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only natural that, finding themselves
in the company of such men as Fields, who
were wrapped up heart and soul in the determination
of the expedition to cross the mighty
mountain chain that was known to stand as a
barrier between the plains and the far distant
Western sea, the boys should become daily
more and more deeply interested in the enterprise.</p>

<p>By degrees even the stern resolution of Dick
to let nothing tempt him to delay his return
to the mother whom he missed so much, was
weakening; and it seemed probable that in the
end he would be ready to accede to Roger’s
eager plea that they cast their fortunes in with
the others, on condition that the signed document
could be surely carried to Grandfather
Armstrong by a trusty messenger.</p>

<p>As they ascended higher up the river, and it
became clearer, the fishing became greatly improved.
Often of an evening, when waiting
for supper to be announced, Roger would indulge
to his heart’s content in his favorite
sport; so that many a time he was able to
supply fish for the whole camp.</p>

<p>There were other ways in which the two lads
proved that they were hunters with a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
knowledge of the habits of game. When the
river ran through great sections of wooded
country, as frequently happened, they would
take a dugout canoe, and, after dark had set
in, push further up-stream, keeping close to
the shore, and carrying a lighted torch in the
bow.</p>

<p>In this way they frequently sighted deer
that were feeding in the water, possibly
making a meal from certain lily pads they
fancied. Startled by the sudden glow of the
wonderful fire, they would often stand there,
staring as though unable to understand what
it all meant, until the keen eyes of those in the
boat sighted them, when a well-aimed arrow
would very likely provide the camp with another
abundant supply of food.</p>

<p>Once the boys came unexpectedly on a buffalo
bull also standing knee-deep in the river,
drinking his fill, or cooling off after a warm
day. And Roger, being quick to act, had fired
his feathered barb almost before Dick could
warn him to be careful. The result was that
the wounded beast charged the boat, and upset
it, so that the boys were given wet jackets, and
might have even suffered the loss of their long-barreled
guns only that they had the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
sense to keep a tight grip on these as they
floundered in the water.</p>

<p>The enraged and wounded buffalo was ready
to attack them again, and so Dick, in order to
settle the matter in their favor, was compelled
to make use of his rifle, shooting the bull at
close quarters, just as he was rushing toward
the spot where Roger was splashing in his
endeavor to keep his head above the surface.</p>

<p>It can be understood that after such an experience
Roger was apt to stay his hand whenever
it happened that they discovered a buffalo
in the river; since another time they might
not chance to be so fortunate.</p>

<p>So the days passed, and the pioneer boys
were enjoying themselves vastly; but the time
came when the peaceful scene was suddenly
changed. There seemed to be a commotion
ahead, and the boys, who had been riding in
the rear, galloped up in order to learn what
it all meant.</p>

<p>Some of the scouts had come in to announce
that they were now drawing close to the Mandan
village, where Captain Lewis was thinking
of settling down for the autumn and winter, if
the signs were favorable. This meant, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
could make the chief a good friend by the bestowal
of presents, such as looking-glasses,
beads, knives, and other things kept in stock
for this very purpose.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, they say, we ought to be
there,” Roger told Dick, as they rode on.</p>

<p>“Yes, and oh! how I hope that we will find
Jasper Williams waiting for the expedition
to arrive,” returned Dick, with considerable
emotion; for the longer this meeting was delayed,
the more it began to get upon their
nerves.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Roger, turning philosopher
for once, “we’ve been so lucky up to
now that I don’t see how we could miss getting
his signature to that paper. He must be
in the Mandan village; and by to-morrow
night we may have had the two captains witness
the signing of his name, that will mean
so much to all at home.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Roger, and I believe the
same, deep in my heart,” Dick went on.
“And, even if he should be away when we get
to the Mandan village, it can only be for a
short time. We will find him, believe that, if
we have to go out after him.”</p>

<p>All that evening they were rather silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
The near approach of the crisis in their affairs
rather appalled the lads. They had anticipated
this thing for so long a time, that the
coming of the fateful hour, when all must be
put to the test, rather unnerved them.</p>

<p>Little sleep visited their eyes that night, for
Captain Lewis had informed them that some
time on the morrow they would reach the Mandan
village. He had received a message from
Williams, reporting that the great chief of the
Mandans was disposed to be friendly, and was
sending a token of amity in the shape of presents,
being handsome robes, decorated after
the Indian custom, and very valuable.</p>

<p>With the coming of the dawn the expedition
again commenced its forward move. As the
river flowed smoothly all through this region
they were able to make rapid progress
throughout the morning, and most of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>About three o’clock they came to the great
Mandan village, situated among the trees in a
place where the country was rolling. Long
before they arrived they knew they were drawing
near the place, from the uproar that
greeted their ears—the beating of tomtoms,
barking of dogs, neighing of horses, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
manner of sounds that would indicate unusual
excitement.</p>

<p>Then a large band of warriors came out to
greet them, with orders that the white men
should be given all honors as the guests of the
chief. Thus those on the three boats, as well
as that part of the expedition ashore, were escorted
to the village, amid a great clamor.
But it was to be noticed that the soldiers kept
close together, and had their guns always in a
condition for immediate use, to impress the
Indians with their ability to defend themselves.</p>

<p>But the Mandans were evidently disposed
to be friendly. They lacked the fierce disposition
of the Sioux, with whom they were constantly
at war, though they could fight, and
bravely too, when they had to.</p>

<p>Once in the Indian village, the boys saw a
thousand things of interest around them; for
this was the first opportunity they ever had
had to roam about among the lodges of a large
Indian camp. But they were in a fever of suspense
concerning Jasper Williams; for surely
the scout would have shown himself at their
approach, had he been there.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis, knowing the anxious state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
their minds, had promised to ask the chief
concerning the scout in his first interview;
and they hung around the wigwam which, by
its gay markings, they knew must be the council
chamber, and into which both the captains
had been led half an hour before.</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” announced Roger,
finally, in a gleeful tone.</p>

<p>Dick did not answer, for he could see that
Captain Lewis looked serious, as though he
had rather disappointing news for them; and
his heart seemed to almost cease beating for a
brief interval as the leader of the explorers advanced
toward the spot where he and Roger
stood awaiting him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>STRANGE SIGHTS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Dick</span>, he looks as if he was bringing us bad
news!” exclaimed Roger, quickly. “Oh! I
hope nothing has happened to Jasper Williams!
What if he should be dead! All our
long journey would be for nothing; and we
would not be able to save the homestead property
after all.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Dick, laying a hand on his
cousin’s arm. “I hardly think it can be as
bad as that. At the worst I think we’ll learn
that he has gone out again to scout around.
They say he can’t keep quiet for an hour; I
guess he’s built on the same plan as you are,
Roger. But here’s the captain.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, my lads,” observed Captain
Lewis, as he came up to them; “but your
patience will have to hold out a few more days,
it seems.”</p>

<p>“Jasper Williams—is he away, then?”
asked Roger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the commander, “he did
not expect us to get up here so soon, it seems;
and, only three days ago, started out on another
wide detour, to find what the hostile
Sioux were doing; for we’ve had more or less
trouble with them at times. He may not be
back for a week or so.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’re disappointed,” said Dick,
bravely hiding his chagrin, “but I guess we’ll
have to stand it, and wait for him to come in.”</p>

<p>“There may be some way of reaching him
and letting him know that we are here in the
Mandan village, where we have met with a
warm welcome,” the captain went on.</p>

<p>“In what way, may I ask, sir?” questioned
Dick, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I understand that Williams left word with
our friend, the Mandan chief here, that he
would swing around in a few days to a certain
salt-lick; and that, if the other wished to send
him out any word, he could have a brave meet
him there.”</p>

<p>“Oh! perhaps we might go with that messenger!”
exclaimed Roger, immediately.</p>

<p>“It might be so arranged, I suppose,” the
captain observed, smiling at the eagerness exhibited
by the boy, which he could easily understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
These lads had quite won his heart
in the days they had spent with the explorers.</p>

<p>“When would he be going out to find Jasper
Williams?” asked Dick, himself just as anxious
as Roger, to hasten the meeting with the
man who held the fate of their homes in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Some time to-morrow, the chief promised
me,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“And is this salt-lick far away from
here?” continued Dick; not that he and his
cousin were anxious to set eyes on it, except
that it marked the meeting-place with the
scout, for they knew what a salt-lick was like,
and had often heard their fathers tell of the
wild animals they used to shoot, far back in
Kentucky and Ohio, when they came to partake
of the much-prized salt to be found at one
of these places. (<a id="Note_6r"></a><a href="#Note_6">Note 6</a>.)</p>

<p>“Not more than a day’s journey, I understand,
so that you could easily get to it before
night, if you started early,” Captain Lewis
went on. “We will in all probability remain
where we are for a long time, perhaps throughout
the winter, so that all these matters can be
easily arranged; only I appreciate how anxious
you must be to find Williams. Please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
yourselves, my lads; I am ready to do almost
anything for you.”</p>

<p>“And we can never forget that, sir,” replied
Roger, as he gave the other a look of
affection; for, during the time they had been
in the society of Captain Meriwether Lewis,
they had come to admire him more than almost
any man they had ever met.</p>

<p>While they continued to wander around the
great Mandan village, and observe the many
strange things to be seen there, they felt a sort
of impatience for the morrow to come, in order
that they might hunt for Jasper Williams.</p>

<p>The warriors had taken their cue from the
friendly attitude of their chief, and were disposed
to welcome the palefaces who had come
from the far distant Land of the Rising Sun.</p>

<p>As for the squaws and younger element, they
followed the boys around wherever they went,
observing their guns, their clothes, and even
their powder-horns, with the deepest interest,
as though they had never before set eyes on
such wonders.</p>

<p>Several of the boldest Indian lads were disposed
to be friendly, and make advances,
though they knew not a word of English; but
then, signs can go a great way, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
among youngsters, and it was not long before
both pioneer boys felt as if they had made
good friends of these dark-faced Mandans.
The bestowal of a few little trinkets, with
which they had provided themselves, caused
the most remarkable exhibition of interest.
After that the crowds following them grew
larger than ever.</p>

<p>Hearing that the wonderful medicine-man of
the tribe had been chasing away the Evil Spirit
that was making a fever come upon a sick man,
the white boys expressed a desire to see him,
and, when their new friends understood this,
they led the way to his lodge, which was apart
from all the others.</p>

<p>Here he came, after a bit, the queerest figure
either of the white boys had ever seen in
all their lives. (<a id="Note_7r"></a><a href="#Note_7">Note 7</a>.)</p>

<p>He paused long enough to gravely extend a
skinny hand to each of the boys, and utter the
one word he knew of English, just as Indians
of to-day repeat it:</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>Then, as if not wishing to remain on exhibition
longer, he shook himself so that the little
shells, rattlesnake rattles, dried gourds filled
with pebbles, and other articles attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to his person gave forth, every variety of
quaint sound, and vanished within his teepee.</p>

<p>The boys could hardly keep from laughing
aloud, the old magician looked so ridiculous in
his make-up as a “doctor,” who could chase
away the spell cast about a sick person by the
Evil Spirit, and by some “hocus-pocus,” as
Roger called it, such as lying on the invalid,
breathing into his nostrils, droning a singsong
tune like nothing ever heard before by the ears
of white men, and many other silly practices.</p>

<p>As they came near the village the boys had
noticed that in a wood on a little mound there
were numerous strange bundles, done up in
dried buffalo hides, and tied with leather
thongs, reposing on elevated platforms, which
they could not make out at all. Fields told
them, however, that this was the burial-place
of the tribe; and he even pointed to various
earthen vessels that were filled with food of a
certain kind, resembling succotash. This, he
stated, the Mandans believed was necessary,
when members of the tribe had recently died,
because they would need some sort of nourishment
while on their long journey to the Happy
Hunting Grounds.</p>

<p>“During the night,” Fields told them, “of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
course the hungry wild animals can creep up,
and clean out these bowls. The Indians must
know this, but they prefer to delude themselves
with the idea that the spirit of the dead
person has come in the night, and eaten the
offering.”</p>

<p>Being deeply interested, the two boys made
a close inspection of the place. In the open
center of the burial-place were many skulls
formed in a circle, all facing inward.</p>

<p>“What can they do that for?” asked Roger,
who was hardly able to repress a shudder at
the grim sight.</p>

<p>“I asked Fields, and he told me that, after
the platforms break down, the skulls of the
dead persons are preserved, and placed here.
Although in life, perhaps, the brave has beaten
his squaw many times, after he is gone she can
be found here every day, talking to this poor
old reminder of his presence on earth. Yes,
he said she would caress it, even if, when the
brave was alive, he had nothing but blows for
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, they are a queer lot,” Roger confessed,
“and I suppose whites never could understand
them. Ugh! let’s get away from
here, Dick. We ought to find something more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
cheerful to look at than this graveyard of
mummies.” (<a id="Note_8r"></a><a href="#Note_8">Note 8</a>.)</p>

<p>“I’m wondering why they have so many
yellow dogs around,” Dick remarked; “but
then, all Indians like baked dog; and Fields
says they serve them up on any special occasion
when they give a great feast. You know
they have no regular time for eating, like white
people, but wait till they’re real hungry, and
then just fill up till they look as if they would
burst.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” Roger went on to say, “Pat
O’Mara used to tell about Indians who would
go hungry for three days, just to get their appetite
good and gnawing, and then start in
and eat for two hours. I don’t think that
would suit me.”</p>

<p>Tiring at length of peering around among
the painted lodges, and seeing the queer sights
with which the Indian village seemed to be
filled—queer to their eyes, although perfectly
natural to the dusky natives who knew no other
way of living—the boys finally rejoined the
rest of the party.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis was only making a temporary
camp as yet, and sticking by his boats. He believed
that the Mandans meant to be the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of friends to his little force; still, many of the
frontiersmen had but a poor opinion of all redmen,
and made him not trust any one with Indian
blood in his veins. When he came to
know the old chief better, and they could feel
perfectly safe, then it would be time to locate
a permanent camp for the winter. And, yet,
they would never cease to keep themselves in
constant readiness, so that a surprise and a
massacre might not come about.</p>

<p>Of course, having made up their minds to go
forth on the following morning, when a messenger
was to start for the distant salt-lick,
Dick and his cousin could think of little else.
Again and again that evening they would turn
away from the conversation that was general
around one of the fires to talk it over, and
agree as to what they should carry with them.</p>

<p>“Captain Lewis said that the warrior would
start an hour after daylight; so we must be
up early, and get our breakfast,” Dick remarked.</p>

<p>“Shall we carry our blankets, and some
food, besides our guns?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that necessary, as we expect
to spend only one night, or a couple at most,
at the lick,” Dick replied. “Perhaps it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
be only proper if we carried some pemmican
along. And, should the chance come, we might
shoot an antelope, or a buffalo, and get plenty
of fresh meat. The brave will be only too glad
to show us where one can be found, if only to
hear the thunder of the ‘talking-sticks.’”</p>

<p>“How can we sleep when all this noise is going
on?” asked Roger, referring to the shouting
of brown-faced pappooses, barking of dogs,
and loud voices of the squaws as they jabbered
among themselves, not being allowed to join
in with the warriors, who were mingling freely
with the soldiers and hunters of the expedition.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’ll quiet down after a while,” Dick
replied, laughingly. “They cannot keep it up
much longer. And by the time you’re ready
to turn in, I promise you it’ll all be as silent
as a church between meeting-days.”</p>

<p>And somehow Dick turned out to be a good
prophet, for an hour later it seemed as though
even the yellow curs that went slinking about
the village had been warned that the time for
making a racket was passed; for they seldom
gave tongue, except to bay the moon occasionally;
and then some brave was apt to slip out
of a lodge, and hurl a stone at the offender.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Dick, as he and his cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
were getting ready to crawl under their
blankets, tired, and ready for sleep.</p>

<p>“I hear what you mean, Dick, and it is a
sure enough wolf, too. I’ve listened to too
many of them not to know the sound.”</p>

<p>“And it is over in the direction of that
place where all the platforms are standing, or
tumbling down, you know, Roger,” pursued
the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, showing that the wolves, coyotes, and
foxes must find a regular treat out there every
night, in the bowls meant for the spirits of the
dead braves. How silly it all seems, Dick!”</p>

<p>“To us, yes; but it’s all right for these Indians.
And, Roger, if some of them went to
the towns and cities of the palefaces, don’t
you think they’d look on lots of things the
white people do, and believe them just as foolish?
It depends on which way you’ve been
brought up. Father says that what’s food for
one man is poison to another.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” Roger replied; and
that finished the talk, for with the far-away,
mournful howl of that gray wolf still sounding
in their ears at intervals, the two lads fell
asleep.</p>

<p>They were up before daylight, and got some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
breakfast ready, because word had been received
from the Mandan chief the night before
that the brave, who was to be Captain
Lewis’s messenger, would be ready to start at
exactly an hour after dawn, while the sun was
still peeping above the horizon; and they did
not wish to delay his departure if they could
help it.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis even arose before there was
any necessity for his appearance, just to shake
the boys by the hand, and wish them the best
of good luck.</p>

<p>“Here is the brave who is going to take you
to the salt-lick,” he remarked, as a Mandan
warrior came up, carrying a bow and a quiver
of arrows, as well as a small pouch made of
fine otter skin, in which he kept his paints and
other essentials that went with the office of a
messenger brave. “I have given him to understand
that he will be held accountable for
your safety; and, when you both come back
unharmed, he is to receive several handsome
presents. His name stands for the Wolf That
Howls in the Night; but you can just know
him as the Wolf. And now, good-by to you
both. We shall be glad when you come back
with Williams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The valiant explorer shook them warmly by
the hand; then, as the Indian glided silently
away, the boys followed in his wake, filled with
fresh hopes that both sincerely trusted might
not be doomed to disappointment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>AT THE SALT-LICK</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> seems as though we were foolish not to
have brought our horses with us, Dick,”
Roger said, when noon had come and gone,
and they were still pressing on at the side of
the Mandan brave, mostly through timber.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied his comrade, “I’ve been
sorry more than once that we made up our
minds to let the poor beasts have a rest, while
we were gone on this little hunt for Jasper
Williams. But as the Wolf expected to travel
afoot, I thought it would be all right.”</p>

<p>“But you know he’s used to tramping it,
day after day. He’s a strong man, and his
muscles are like iron; while we’re only boys,
you see, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Still, we’ve gone through more than a little
in our time, Roger,” the other rejoined.</p>

<p>“That’s true; and I’m not played out, let
me tell you,” Roger asserted; “only we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
just as well have had horses, and taken things
easy. The Wolf could have run alongside,
and we’d have reached the salt-lick quicker
than we seem likely to do at this rate.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to get it out of him how
much farther we have to go; it’s like pounding
a hole through a rock; but at last he
seemed to understand, and held up three
fingers. But just what that means is the
question. It might be that we are three miles
away from the salt-lick; and then again perhaps
it’s still three hours’ walk.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to grin and bear it, as old
Pat O’Mara used to say,” observed Roger,
whose spirits refused to remain cast down for
any length of time.</p>

<p>“And we’ve not had the good luck to get
close to any game to fire a single shot,” Dick
complained.</p>

<p>“But they told us in the village that we’d
be almost sure to get a chance at some sort of
wild animal at the lick; for they come there
right along. I’m hoping that it’ll be antelope.
I’ve never forgotten how fine that meat tasted
to us; and nothing would please me so much
as to have more of the same kind.”</p>

<p>Roger licked his lips as he said this, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
though the very mention of that feast made
his mouth water.</p>

<p>“One thing, sure,” Dick went on, “the
summer has gone, and autumn is coming along
now. You can feel the tang of it in the early
morning air. Why, before long we’ll be
having frost, if this keeps on.”</p>

<p>“Just think how many weeks it has been
since we left home,” said Roger, as if at times
hardly able to believe the fact himself.</p>

<p>“And what a long distance lies between us
and those dear ones,” added Dick; “but, if
things go well, we can soon be starting back
down the river again.”</p>

<p>“There, look, Dick, the Wolf is making gestures
again! He wants to tell you something,
I believe. And I hope it is that we’re getting
close to the lick at last.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak so loud, Roger, he seems to
be making a motion with his arm as if to point
ahead; then he puts his finger on his lips,
which must mean that he wants us to keep as
still as a mouse. I really believe we must be
close by, or else he’s discovered signs of
Sioux, and wants us to be on our guard.”</p>

<p>“No, he’s beckoning to us to come on, now,
Dick, and he wouldn’t do that if he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
there were enemies around. It must be the
lick,” Roger went on, lowering his voice to a
whisper, at which the Mandan brave smiled,
and nodded his head, as though he approved.</p>

<p>They began to exercise more caution as they
crept forward. The boys, being hunters themselves,
noticed several things that gave them
cause to look upon their guide as one who
knew his business.</p>

<p>“See how he sneaks along, with never a
sound as his feet touch the ground,” Roger
whispered in the ear of his companion. “Did
you ever see anything to beat that? No matter
how sharp your hearing might be, you’d
never catch the first sound with the Wolf
moving along.”</p>

<p>“And another thing, Roger, you can see
that the breeze is right in our faces. He
circled around a little, for I noticed it, and
wondered why at the time. Now I know. It
was to come in at the lick so as to not alarm
any animal that might happen to be there
ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of timber around,” remarked the
other, signifying with a nod of his head the
trees they were passing.</p>

<p>“Yes, lots of it; and now, let’s drop all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
talk,” suggested Dick, after which silence fell
upon them.</p>

<p>They tried to imitate the stealthy manner of
advance shown by the Wolf, but realized that
they would have considerable to learn before
they might equal his noiseless method of
placing each foot on the ground, with a quick,
accurate movement. Roger believed that a
panther could never have walked with a more
velvety tread than did that agile Mandan warrior,
accustomed to this sort of thing from
childhood.</p>

<p>It began to grow a little irksome after a
while; but they believed that it must soon
come to an end, and that thought comforted
both lads.</p>

<p>If anything, the caution of the Wolf increased.
This would seem to indicate that
they must be getting very close to the end of
their journey, and both boys began to imagine
they could tell just where the lick must lie.</p>

<p>Yes, their guide was heading straight for a
thick clump of bushes under the trees, and,
from the looks of things, they fancied they
were at the end of the tramp.</p>

<p>The Wolf turned his head then to make a
gesture, and nod, just as if he wanted them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
understand that they had arrived. Then the
three crept forward, a foot at a time. Roger
almost held his breath with the suspense, although
accustomed to hunting in all its
branches. Would they discover any kind of
wild animal there, licking the salty rock; or
were they fated to be disappointed?</p>

<p>Still, even though there happened to be no
game in sight, that was not saying their
chance would not come a little later. All they
would have to do would be to conceal themselves,
and wait, when perhaps a deer, or a
buffalo, would appear, bent on gratifying the
taste for salt that holds such a strong fascination
for most four-footed animals.</p>

<p>Another minute, and they were eagerly
peering through the thick bushes. They could
see where the lick lay, for it was in the open,
and the ground all around had been trampled
by many hoofs.</p>

<p>Roger heaved a sigh of disappointment, for
there was no sign of antelope, buffalo or any
wild animal. On his part Dick felt a keen
sense of chagrin, but from another cause; he
had secretly hoped to see the form of a white
scout lounging in the open, and that would
mean, that their long search was at an end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
with the much sought Jasper Williams before
them. But it was not to be.</p>

<p>The Wolf, if also surprised not to find
game there, after all their labor in making such
a skillful advance, showed no signs of disappointment.
He had doubtless learned early
in life that a warrior must never give way to
such feelings. When things do not come his
way it is his business to keep plodding along
until the tide changes, for everything comes to
him who waits, even game at a salt-lick.</p>

<p>There was no longer any reason why they
should crouch in an uncomfortable attitude.
It was just as well to straighten up, relieve
their tired muscles, go forward and examine
the lick; and then, when the mood seized them,
find a new hiding-place, where they could lie
in wait.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dick, let’s see what the old thing
looks like,” Roger remarked, as he stepped
out from the screen of bushes.</p>

<p>Both the Mandan brave and Dick followed
at his heels, for the latter was also curious to
investigate. He had never seen a salt-lick, although
told about such places by his father,
as they were more plentiful away back in Kentucky
than along the Mississippi. And it repaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
them for the trouble they had experienced
in making this stealthy advance.</p>

<p>It was easy to see where the salt rock
cropped out from the ground. In several
places animals had actually worn a hole in it
with their rough tongues. Their hoofs had
also made various trails in front of each exposed
salt rock, and Roger could easily see
how a hunter, lying concealed in the bushes
within a short arrow-flight of the spot, would
be able to bring down his game. No doubt
many a tragedy had taken place there, and
Roger could picture them in his mind while
examining the surroundings.</p>

<p>Dick was still thinking of Jasper Williams.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he could have been here, and
gone again,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh! I had about lost track of what we
were coming out after—you mean the scout,
Williams. And, sure enough, he isn’t here, is
he, Dick? Now, that’s another disappointment.
We might have found him waiting for
some message from the Mandan chief. Well,
there’s only one thing we can do—camp here,
and wait for one or the other to show up—game,
or Jasper.”</p>

<p>“The Wolf seems to be examining something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
on the ground, which, I take it, must be
tracks,” announced Dick.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps our man <i>has</i> been here, and
gone again?” ventured Roger, in a startled
tone.</p>

<p>“No, because he was to leave some sign behind
him, a bark message in the crotch of a
stick, perhaps, and there’s nothing of the kind
around, Roger, you see.”</p>

<p>“Well, but the Wolf seems to be bending
over more than ever. Do you think it can be
game he scents? Why, there are dozens of
tracks here, and I don’t see how any particular
set could interest him,” Roger continued.</p>

<p>“Let’s go forward and see for ourselves,”
Dick suggested.</p>

<p>As they came alongside the Mandan brave
he pointed to certain marks at his feet. Both
lads saw that these were the faint impressions
of moccasins. But that in itself gave them no
cause for uneasiness, and it was not until the
Wolf pointed once more, and uttered a word
they took to be “Sioux,” that they understood.
Some of the deadly enemies of the
Mandans had only recently been at the salt-lick;
and that might mean they were contemplating
an attack on the great Mandan village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
hardly more than half a day’s journey
away.</p>

<p>Efforts had plainly been made to erase the
footprints, which would indicate that the
Sioux had some reason for not wanting their
enemies to know of their presence so close
by.</p>

<p>Somehow the fact gave both boys an uneasy
feeling, and again Dick found himself wishing
that he had thought to bring the horses; then,
in case of trouble, they would have had a
means for beating a successful retreat.</p>

<p>Roger did not look so far ahead as his comrade,
as a rule. He was even now wondering
what the Wolf saw in these old tracks to cause
him alarm. Why, from time to time no doubt
lots of Indians, perhaps belonging to various
tribes, must visit this spot, since it was the
only salt-lick in all the surrounding country,
he had been told.</p>

<p>“Now, for my part,” he started to say, “I
don’t see why he should bother with a lot of
tracks. Perhaps they are days old. What if
the Sioux did try to hide the marks of their
moccasins; they’d know the Mandans could
tell from the tread that Sioux braves had been
here, and, if they were just out on a hunt, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
might be they wouldn’t want to have any
trouble with their old-time enemies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that might be as you say, Roger; but
if you look close you’ll see that it <i>wasn’t</i> days
ago these tracks were made. No dew has ever
fallen in this footprint, which would go to show
it was not here at dawn this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Roger, “then, if these
marks have been made since sun-up, that’s a
different story; and perhaps the Wolf does
well to look serious. These fierce Sioux are a
lot of fighters, they say. The expedition has
had ever so much trouble with them while on
the way. Now, if we have to leave here before
we meet Jasper Williams, it will be too mean
for anything.”</p>

<p>“That must be as the Wolf says, and perhaps
he can make us understand by motions
what he thinks about it. There, see him bending
down again over yonder, as if he had discovered
something else. Those eyes of his are
like a hawk’s, and little can escape them.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would hurry up then, and let us
know the worst,” grumbled Roger.</p>

<p>Dick was about to say something more, when
the words seemed to cleave to the roof of his
mouth, for something remarkable had happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
something that was so utterly unexpected
that he could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>He saw a swift descending object fall directly
upon the stooping Mandan brave, and
bear him to the ground with the force of the
collision. His first impression was that the assailant
must be a hungry panther; and then he
discovered that it bore more resemblance to a
human being, although the two intertwined
figures whirled over and over with such incredible
swiftness that he could not make sure.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Roger, as here and there
dark figures began to drop, as though the thick
branches of the overhanging trees were raining
human fruit; and now it did not require
more than one look to tell that these were
feathered Indians, undoubtedly Sioux braves,
who, seeing their approach toward the salt-lick,
had laid this cunning trap to surprise
them.</p>

<p>Dick started to throw his gun to his shoulder.
It was an involuntary movement, for he could
have but little hope of escaping from that circle
of enemies; but it was only to have the weapon
snatched from his hands, while he was borne
to the ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>RUNNING ELK, THE SIOUX CHIEF</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of their struggles the two boys were
made prisoners, as was the Mandan warrior.
There seemed to be fully a score of the hostile
braves; but Dick, as soon as he could look
around him, after such rough handling, told
his cousin they were not on the warpath, because
they had not painted themselves, nor did
they wear the feathers in their hair that would
indicate a foray, and an expected battle.</p>

<p>It was evidently a hunting party in quest of
fresh meat, and they had taken chances of falling
in with some of their enemies in thus coming
to the salt-lick, hoping to find game there.</p>

<p>They seemed greatly interested in the guns
taken from the white boys. Apparently these
were an almost unknown thing among the
Sioux, who hunted with bows and arrows in
those early days, just as their ancestors had
done before them.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they’ll do with us?”
asked Roger, who looked forlorn. He had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
scratch on his cheek, from which his face had
become smeared with blood, although in answer
to Dick’s anxious question he said that it
did not amount to anything.</p>

<p>“Take us to their village, I’m afraid,” Dick
answered, shortly, for he was trying to figure
out some plan that offered at least a shred of
hope; but, after many attempts, he was obliged
to confess that he could see little relief ahead.</p>

<p>There followed considerable jabbering
among the warriors. It seemed as though
they were disputing about something, although
Dick fancied that this was only their way of
conversing.</p>

<p>“Do you think one side wants to put us to
the torture right away, and the other is for
holding out till they get back to their village?”
asked Roger, nervously; for, in spite
of his stout heart, the prospect was enough to
alarm any one.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it’s quite as bad as
that,” replied his cousin, trying to assume a
confidence he was far from feeling. “They’re
just having a palaver about whether to head
straight back home, or continue the hunt.
That is, I guess as much from the way they
point toward the northwest, and then at us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what will happen when we get there,
Dick? Can’t you think up something to get us
out of this scrape?” asked Roger, turning as
usual to his stronger cousin, when trouble descended
upon them.</p>

<p>“I’m trying the best I know how, Roger, but
so far I’ve thought of nothing that would help
us. But we must keep up brave hearts. Even
the warlike Sioux have no reason to hate you
and me. We have never hurt them in any way,
and the most they can have against us is that
we’re white boys, and have come to their
country without asking permission from Running
Elk, their great chief.”</p>

<p>“But will they put us to the torture, as they
do their red enemies whenever they make them
prisoner?” Roger asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” answered his companion.
“They may take a notion to adopt us into
their tribe. Don’t you think, Roger, that we’d
make pretty good-looking Sioux braves? Both
of us have dark hair, and, with some feathers
in it, we’d pass for Indians right now. I’ve
only got one little hope outside of that.”</p>

<p>“Then please tell me what it is, Dick, because
things look so dark ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Stop and remember, Roger, how it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
when we were on that island, with the angry
waters creeping up, and threatening to make
us swim for it—we said then it was darkest
before dawn, and didn’t it turn out to be that
way? Well, how can we tell but what the same
thing may happen to us now, and that out of
this capture by the Sioux great good may
come?”</p>

<p>“I only wish I had half your faith, Dick,”
sighed Roger; “but they’ve made up their
minds what to do, and are turning this way,
as if meaning to start off on a long tramp.
Tell me before they come for us what that one
little hope is, that you said you could see. And
I pray that it may turn out for the best.”</p>

<p>“It is our guns, Roger,” the other went on
hastily.</p>

<p>“What about them?” demanded Roger.
“We will never be given a chance to snatch
them away from the braves who are now carrying
them so proudly. And, even if we did, what
would two shots mean among twenty foes?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand me,” Dick replied.
“Our guns are an object of curiosity to every
warrior. They will be sure to carry them to
the big chief, as his property. Of course not
one of them knows a thing about how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
‘shooting-sticks’ are used to make the great
noise, and cause the game to fall down, while
no arrow is seen to shoot through the air.
Then he will send for us, perhaps, and make
us an offer to spare our lives if we will show
him how to fire the guns, and be taken into the
tribe. Yes, I think our only hope lies in the
secret of shooting the fire and smoke from
those guns. But here they come to get us
now.”</p>

<p>“And I’m tired already from our long
walk,” sighed Roger. “I hope they won’t try
to keep it up all night, for I’d drop in my
tracks. And, Dick, we’d have shown more
sense if we’d just stuck to the camp, and
waited for Jasper to come in.”</p>

<p>Dick was thinking the same thing himself;
but then he was not much of a fellow to cry
after the milk was spilt. What was done could
not be helped and, instead of bemoaning their
hard luck, Dick believed in cudgeling his
brains in an effort to find some solution to the
problem.</p>

<p>The Sioux had evidently decided to head
direct for their distant village. Their unexpected
luck in making prisoners of the two
white boys had excited them considerably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
They seemed to think that when those at home
saw the palefaces they would forgive the lack
of fresh meat. Antelope and buffalo could be
killed at any time, but it was a rare event to
have white prisoners in the strong lodge, and
be given a chance to handle those wonderful
“shooting-sticks” that, when pointed at an
enemy, spat out flame and smoke, and in some
mysterious way encompassed the death of the
thing aimed at.</p>

<p>Forming around the prisoners, the warrior
band started off. Both boys felt as though a
heavy weight had been attached to their
shoulders, their spirits had so fallen. Just a
short half hour before they had been full of
eager anticipation concerning the expected
meeting with Jasper Williams; but now
the heavens had clouded over, and all was
gloom.</p>

<p>Still, they took pattern from the jaunty
manner of the Wolf. He had been sorely
wounded in his fight with the three Sioux who
had pounced upon him, after a descending
brave had knocked him down and clutched
him, but not for worlds would the Wolf show
the white feather.</p>

<p>“We can do no less than a red heathen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Roger,” Dick had said, when calling the attention
of his cousin to the proud manner of the
other prisoner; and somehow this seemed to
have a great influence upon both white boys,
so that they forced themselves to appear quite
at their ease, even while inwardly groaning
with physical pain, and mental tortures respecting
their uncertain future.</p>

<p>Long did the Sioux walk in that steady manner.
Night fell, but they gave not the slightest
evidence of feeling distressed, although doubtless
they, too, had been on the go since early
dawn.</p>

<p>When some hours had passed since the sun
went down, Roger complained that his legs
were actually giving out under him. Perhaps
some of the Indians had noticed that his gait
was becoming rather wobbly; for a word was
spoken, and to the great relief of the white
prisoners they came to a halt.</p>

<p>The Sioux took the precaution to tie their
ankles with deerskin thongs; but no fire was
kindled, nor were there any signs of a meal in
prospect. Perhaps some of those prostrate
braves chewed at dry pemmican as they lay
there, resting; but, even though they had not
a single bite, that would have mattered little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
so great were their powers of endurance when
out on the hunt, or the warpath. The same
warriors would doubtless loiter around the village
for days and weeks, and appear to be the
most indolent and lazy of their kind, until an
occasion arose for them to once more display
their ability to withstand fatigue and hunger.</p>

<p>The weary boys slept, in spite of their discomfort.
Nature would not be denied; and
while Dick woke up several times during the
night, he found himself much refreshed as
dawn broke once more.</p>

<p>Again was the march resumed, and all
through the day, with only a short stop at
about noon, did they keep heading into the
northwest.</p>

<p>Roger would have given out but for the
earnest pleas of his cousin, and his own natural
dislike to appear weak in the eyes of these
brawny braves. They had been given some dry
food in the morning, before the start was made,
and also at noon, and, though neither had much
heart for eating, Dick advised that they force
themselves to do so, because they would surely
need all their strength in order to pull
through.</p>

<p>Again and again did Dick continue to paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
a possible rainbow of promise in the blank
heavens; but Roger could not see it, no matter
how earnestly he looked.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to keep going, just to please you,
Dick,” he would say; “but I’m feeling so terribly
that it would almost be a mercy if one
of these fellows put an arrow through me right
now.”</p>

<p>It was toward the end of the afternoon that
the Indians with them set up a loud and triumphant
series of whoops.</p>

<p>“We must be near the village!” declared
Dick, and even forlorn Roger brightened up a
little.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” he remarked, with a sad smile;
“because it’ll be a change anyway, no matter
what comes. And I tell you, I’ve just about
got to the end of my rope.”</p>

<p>“There, I can see something moving over
at the brow of that low hill,” Dick went on to
say.</p>

<p>“And I hear dogs barking, too, which is a
sure sign,” Roger remarked.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards there remained no longer
any doubt that they had arrived at the Sioux
village; for over the crown of the hill came a
flood of running figures—warriors and boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and old men, as well as squaws, all eager
to see what it was that brought the hunting
party back so soon from their foray. And at
sight of the two white prisoners they manifested
great delight; for it was evidently
the first time most of them had ever set eyes
on a real paleface, though they may have
known some of the half-breeds who had wandered
up this way.</p>

<p>Surrounded by a shouting and dancing
throng, the two boys and the proud Mandan
brave were conducted into the Sioux village.
They may have more than once manifested a
natural desire to look upon such a settlement;
but somehow it did not give them much satisfaction
now. As prisoners, with a dark outlook
ahead of them, the pioneer boys could
hardly be expected to take much interest in the
odd sights that met their eyes among the wigwams
of the warlike Sioux, concerning whom
they had heard so many stories of cruelty and
valor.</p>

<p>Some of the brown-faced boys even pinched
the prisoners to see whether they could stand
pain. Roger was too hot-tempered to put up
with this, and proceeded to kick savagely at
one of his persecutors, but the other jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to one side, and, as the paleface had his hands
tied behind him, he stumbled and fell on his
back, at which a shout went up from the delighted
Sioux boys.</p>

<p>Thus escorted they were taken to a big council
lodge, the outside of which was decorated
with all manner of colored pictures of battles,
the Sioux always being the victors in this historical
catalogue. Just as Dick expected, the
great chief of the Sioux tribe, Running Elk,
was sitting there, cross-legged, on a bearskin
rug, waiting to look at the prisoners, and hear
the story of the capture from the lips of the
participants.</p>

<p>The chief was a powerful-looking man, and
wore a head-dress of magnificent feathers that
trailed down his back to the ground. His deerskin
garments were decorated with colored porcupine
quills, and beads, as well as small shells.
It must have been his “court dress,” as Roger
called it, in which he was accustomed to preside
at the councils of the tribe.</p>

<p>But the face of Running Elk was stern, and
Dick felt his heart grow cold as he looked upon
it. Surely they could expect no mercy from
such a man. Several times had some of the
Sioux attacked the expedition which Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Lewis was leading into the northwestern country;
and, because of their fierce daring, they
had not always issued from these conflicts unscathed.
Perhaps wounds had been received,
and even the death of a warrior might have resulted
from the fire of the explorers’ guns.
And if this were the case, the Sioux would believe
that the Great Spirit had purposely
thrown these two paleface boys into their
hands in order that they might be tortured,
and put to death, so that the departed brave
would have slaves with him on his way to the
Happy Hunting Grounds.</p>

<p>Standing there, the boys felt the keen eyes
of Running Elk upon them. It was as though
the chief was figuring in his mind what species
of torture should be tried upon the palefaces,
in order to appease the grief of the widow of
the departed warrior.</p>

<p>“Now he is motioning for them to hand him
my gun, Dick,” declared Roger, who was doing
the best he knew how to appear at his ease,
while all the time he could feel his heart
thumping against his ribs like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>Dick watched eagerly to see what the chief
would do next. He examined the long rifle all
over, but apparently looked upon it as a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
thing for any one not familiar with its
working to handle.</p>

<p>Finally his eyes again lighted on Dick, and
he made motions to his guards, at the same
time saying something in his quick, harsh
voice.</p>

<p>Apparently the word of the chief was law,
for immediately one of the warriors hastened
to loosen the withes that were wrapped around
the wrists of the boy. Then the chief motioned
to Dick, and held out the gun.</p>

<p>“He wants you to show him how it works,
Dick!” exclaimed Roger, eagerly, as though a
gleam of new hope had come into his soul.</p>

<p>When he had rubbed his hands until the
blood circulated once more, Dick accepted the
gun from the chief. It gave him a queer feeling
to touch it again; but he knew well that
his only chance of escape lay in his being able
to interest the chief so greatly in the “shooting-stick”
that he would spare the lives of the
palefaces in order that they might teach his
braves how to use the wonderful thing.</p>

<p>So Dick beckoned to them to let him walk
outside, which was agreed upon. Surrounded
by a mob of moving figures, the boys were allowed
to emerge from the council lodge. Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
was looking for some target at which to shoot.
This he quickly discovered in a crow that had
alighted on the top of a dead tree some distance
away. Quickly leveling the gun, he took
aim, and fired.</p>

<p>As Dick was a splendid marksman he had no
trouble in bringing down the crow, at which
there was tremendous excitement among the
assembled Indians. One boy ran and brought
back the dead bird, after which every one had
to poke a finger into the hole the bullet had
made. (<a id="Note_9r"></a><a href="#Note_9">Note 9</a>.)</p>

<p>Then Dick, taking his powder-horn, showed
them just how he charged the rifle. He put a
greased piece of rag about the bullet, as was
usual in those days, and rammed it home, after
which he primed the pan, making motions that
the chief was to try the next shot. But, although
Running Elk was known as the bravest
man of his tribe, he shook his head, as if to
signify that he preferred not having anything
to do with such a wonderful invention of the
Evil Spirit.</p>

<p>Still, Dick had high hopes that the desire to
make use of such a powerful agency against the
foes of his tribe might yet influence Running
Elk to spare the lives of his white prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>While the assemblage was still engaged in
discussing these strange things in an excited
manner, the two boys were once more taken
in charge by their guards, who led them
through the village and thrust them into a log
cabin that was undoubtedly the prison, or
strong lodge.</p>

<p>It was growing dark, and the boys could
hardly see each other’s face as they sat there,
with their backs against the rough wall of the
cabin. At least their hands had not been
fastened again, and for that they had reason to
be grateful, though it was such a small thing
after all, when their lives might be at stake.</p>

<p>Long they sat there, trying to squeeze some
hope out of the situation, and listening to the
strange sounds that came to their ears from
without.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Dick, when perhaps an
hour had passed since darkness set in, and they
had eaten the bowls of food thrust into the
strong lodge by one of their dusky guards;
“what can that fresh shout mean, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“It sounds to me as if they had brought in
another prisoner,” Roger declared. “But it
may only be that they are holding a council to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
settle our fate. I remember old Pat O’Mara
saying that was what they always did. We
might peep out through some of these wide
cracks on this side, and see if it is so.”</p>

<p>But, just as they were about to do this, the
door of the cabin was opened again, and the
figure of a man thrown in. He landed in a
heap on the hard ground, and gave a grunt.</p>

<p>“That might have broken my neck, if my
arms had been tied!” they heard the newcomer
say, with what seemed to be a half
chuckle; and it was at once apparent to the
boys that the last prisoner of the Sioux was
also white, like themselves.</p>

<p>Dick coughed, to inform the other that he
was not alone.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked the unseen man,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Two white boys who have been made prisoners
by the Sioux,” replied Dick. “We belong
to Captain Lewis’s party, and came out to
the salt-lick to see if we could meet a scout who
was to report there to a Mandan brave; when
the Indians dropped down on us from the
branches of the trees. Who may you be, sir,
I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“I? I’m the scout who was to leave word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
at the salt-lick; and my name is Jasper Williams!”
came the astonishing reply.</p>

<p>What a meeting, after they had come all
these hundreds upon hundreds of miles especially
to find this man; and now all of them
were prisoners in the hands of the savage
Sioux!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>A DESPERATE SITUATION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surprise of Jasper Williams was overwhelming
when he learned that these two lads
had braved the dangers of the wilderness, week
in and week out, just to find him, so as to get
his signature to a document which Dick carried,
safely sewed inside the lining of his hunting
jacket.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll be only too glad to put my
name on it, if only we can get out of this bad
scrape,” the scout declared, after he had heard
the story, and shaken the hands of Dick and
Roger Armstrong many times. “I know
François Lascelles only too well, and it would
give me great pleasure to balk his little game;
but just now, my brave lads, it looks as if we’d
furnish sport for the heathen at the torture
post before many days go by; they’re feeling
so angry at the whites for coming up here into
their country without first making all manner
of presents to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>At that Roger remembered to tell the scout
what a slender hope he and his cousin were
hugging to their hearts. Jasper Williams considered
it well, but did not seem too sanguine.</p>

<p>“Something might come out of it,” he observed;
“but I know Injun nature too well to
think the chief will spare us for that reason
alone. If the crowd wants to be amused, we’ll
be made to run the gauntlet to-morrow at sunrise;
and afterwards be burned at the stake,
like as not. It’s something I always thought
would happen to me. A borderer who has run
up against Injuns as much as I have must look
forward to the time he’ll be caught napping,
as I was, and pay the penalty with his life. But
I’m sorry for you, lads, because you’ve got
mothers and fathers behind, that’ll mourn if
you never come back again; while there’s none
to weep for old Jasper Williams.”</p>

<p>Roger, who had been busy over at one side
of the cabin, now called out:</p>

<p>“They’ve lighted a big fire there in the
open space, and I can see a lot of the braves
sitting down, cross-legged, around it. Do you
think they’re going to hold a palaver, or council,
to settle what’s to be done with us, Mr.
Williams?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks that way, son,” replied the scout,
with a touch of pity in his rough voice; “but
I can tell better after I have taken a look myself.”</p>

<p>Both he and Dick had little trouble in finding
crevices through which it was possible to
observe all that was going on. The fire around
which the Indians had commenced to gather
was not so far removed from the strong lodge
but the listening prisoners could hear all that
took place.</p>

<p>Only the warriors or fighting men were allowed
places in the several circles that presently
surrounded the leaping flames. The
boys and squaws had to stand back, and take
no part in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Running Elk was there in plain view, as was
also the medicine-man of the tribe, the latter
decked out in his awe-inspiring decorations,
that gave out a jingling sound every time he
moved so much as an arm. As the medicine-man
is usually the power behind the throne in
every Indian village, he can generally be
found at the right hand of the leader or
chief, as an adviser. His favor is eagerly
sought by braves and squaws, for it is popularly
supposed that when angered he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
bring down the wrath of Manitou upon the
offender.</p>

<p>All this while there sounded the monotonous
beating of tomtoms, or drums made of skins
drawn tightly over hollow sections of the
trunk of a tree. It was a weird sound, and
particularly to those who, crouching behind
the logs of the strong lodge, were looking upon
the striking picture of these same Indians deciding
what their fate should be.</p>

<p>For once Roger found no heart for talking,
and it must be something beyond the ordinary
that could quench his desire to express his feelings
in words. Each of them merely sat there,
looking at the strange scene. It was terrible,
and at the same time not one of them could
tear his eyes away from it, such was the fascination
it possessed.</p>

<p>When all of the braves had assembled, the
chief made a signal with his hand, at which
the sound of the beating tomtoms stopped
short. Then a red clay pipe was produced,
and, upon being lighted by the medicine-man,
was first passed to the chief, who sent out a
puff of smoke toward each of the four points
of the compass. Then the pipe was passed to
the next in line, and so on, until, after a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
time, every one in the first circle, evidently
the leading warriors of the tribe, had smoked.
(<a id="Note_10r"></a><a href="#Note_10">Note 10</a>.)</p>

<p>When the pipe was put away, a brave leaped
to his feet, and began an impassioned harangue,
making many gestures.</p>

<p>“He is demanding that all of us be put to
the torture in the morning,” declared Jasper
Williams, who had a fair knowledge of many
of the Indian tongues. Roger shut his teeth
hard together, and repressed the groan that
almost escaped him.</p>

<p>Another and yet another warrior followed
the first. Some spoke more soberly, and these
were the elder ones; perhaps they were counselling
that it might be well to keep the whites
prisoners, and demand certain favors of the
invaders as a recompense for sparing their
lives. But the fiery younger element seemed
to be vastly in the majority, as Dick realized
when a dozen had expressed their views.</p>

<p>What the thoughts of the two boys were
would be hard to say. Doubtless their minds
turned backward to the happy homes, far
away on the bank of the Missouri near its
junction with the greater Mississippi; and
they could picture those they loved so dearly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
waiting as the weeks went by for some tidings
of the brave sons and brothers who had taken
upon themselves the dangerous task of finding
the one man who could save the homesteads
from the scheming French trader.</p>

<p>“It’s all over!” exclaimed Roger, with a
gulp; and the next moment a din arose that
must indeed indicate that the council had been
declared ended.</p>

<p>“What did they decide, Mr. Williams?”
asked Dick, trying his best to keep his voice
from betraying the fact that he was trembling
all over with excitement.</p>

<p>The scout groped in the darkness until he
could put a hand on the shoulder of each boy.
He had bad news to communicate, and in his
simple way wished to give them what little
encouragement the touch of his hand might
possess.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the decision was against us,
lads,” he said, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Then we will never live to see the home
folks again,” spoke Roger, between his set
teeth.</p>

<p>Dick was surprised to find how bravely his
cousin took it, and this convinced him that
much of Roger’s nervousness was on the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and that, when it came to a pinch, he
could show just as strong a front as the next
one.</p>

<p>“But the council has not been dismissed
yet, for the braves are still sitting there as we
saw them,” Dick observed at this juncture.</p>

<p>“Unless I am much mistaken,” Jasper
Williams went on, “they are sending guards
to fetch us out. It was not fitting that we
should be present when they were deciding
our fate; but, now that a judgment has been
rendered, we may be led forth to hear sentence
pronounced by the great chief. My lads, you
know what the red heathen think of any one
who shows the white feather. Be brave now,
I beg of you, for the honor of the white race.
Show them that paleface boys can stand pain
just as well as Injuns are taught to do.”</p>

<p>Just then the door of the strong lodge
opened, and warriors, coming in, seized hold
of the three prisoners; for the Wolf had evidently
been confined in some other prison, perhaps
bound hand and foot, since his fate did
not have to be debated. He was doomed from
the first, being a hated Mandan.</p>

<p>So they were led forth. Roger, determined
to prove that he was a son of his father, shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
his teeth hard together, and made up his mind
that nothing these savage Sioux could do
would make him cry out. Dick managed to
lock his arm in that of his cousin, knowing that
even such contact would give the other heart.</p>

<p>Escape was impossible. All they could do
was to meet their fate bravely. And if Roger
remembered what his cousin had said about it
being the darkest just before dawn, he must
have smiled bitterly as he contemplated the
utter impossibility of anything happening to
save them.</p>

<p>And yet, the bread which they had cast upon
the waters so long ago was due to return to
them, here, now, in this most important crisis
of their lives.</p>

<p>They were hustled through the crowd of
squaws and boys that had gathered outside the
triple circle of warriors. Numbers struck at
them; others pinched them maliciously, and
threw dirt in their faces.</p>

<p>Then suddenly it seemed to Dick that a
miracle had been wrought. A squaw darted
forward, threw one of the guards aside, and,
seizing hold of Roger, looked eagerly in his
face, after which she appeared greatly excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>And Dick felt his heart give a great bound,
as hope once more took possession there; for
he had recognized the face of this old squaw.
It was Karmeet, whom last he remembered
seeing seated at their camp fire, and, with the
Indian girl, Dove Eyes, partaking of their
humble supper, to afterwards disappear so
mysteriously in the night!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>THE DAWN BREAKS—CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most tremendous excitement followed;
for the old squaw, still clinging to Roger, was
appealing to the chief. Running Elk was
listening, too, and seemed greatly interested
in what she was saying.</p>

<p>In fact, the entire assemblage was spell-bound;
warriors and squaws bent their heads
forward, to better catch all that she said, and
whenever Karmeet paused to catch her breath
there could be heard loud sighs.</p>

<p>Dick was thrilled by the sudden change in
their condition. Although he could not tell the
meaning of a single word the old squaw spoke,
it was very evident from her gesticulations
that she was telling the story of how these
white boys had saved the lives of herself and
the Indian girl when the savage panther was
ready to spring down upon them; and afterwards
entertained them beside their camp fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
feeding them, and even covering them with a
blanket to keep the night dews off.</p>

<p>Yes, as the story progressed, and she became
even more excited, he could tell how she
was demanding their lives as a just recompense
for their gallantry toward herself and
her girl companion; for she finally covered
both of them with her hands, and then appealed
to Running Elk.</p>

<p>The great chief of the warlike Sioux seemed
to be considering; but Dick, knowing as much
of Indian character as he did, felt that the case
was already decided. The honor of an Indian
would never allow their being injured after
they had shown themselves friends of the
Sioux.</p>

<p>“Give yourselves no further uneasiness,
lads,” said Jasper Williams, heartily, at that
critical moment. “You have been lucky
enough to do a great service to the sister and
the child of Running Elk himself, for they
bear that relationship to the chief. He is
bound to free you after that. And every Injun
in the village will want to shake hands
with you. I would that my chances were half
as bright.”</p>

<p>“We will refuse to go without you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Jasper,” declared Dick, firmly; for he had
already taken a great liking to the scout; and
besides, was not Williams a most important
factor in the fulfillment of the mission on
which he and Roger had started forth from
the settlement away down the Missouri?</p>

<p>“Listen to what the great chief is about to
say,” remarked the scout, forgetting that he
was the only one of the trio able to interpret
the Sioux tongue.</p>

<p>But, since all Indians make considerable use
of gestures in their oratory, it was not so very
difficult, after all, to comprehend the tenor of
what Running Elk said.</p>

<p>First he asked his sister several quick questions,
to all of which she replied eagerly, pointing
first to Roger, and then his cousin; after
which she led Dove Eyes forward, and the little
girl, too, recognized the lads. After he had
quite satisfied himself that there could be no
mistake, the Sioux chief addressed himself to
the assembled warriors. He grew quite impassioned
in his talk; and often, when he came
to a pause, a chorus of grunts answered him.
But Dick noticed that all the nods of those
grim heads were <i>up and down</i>; and, wise boy
that he was, this told him that the braves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
in complete accord with what Running Elk
was saying.</p>

<p>Finally the chief arose deliberately to his
feet, though none of the others who were sitting
made a move. He walked over to where
the three whites stood, and held out his hand
to Roger first of all; for had not his sister declared
that it was he whose “shooting-stick”
had killed the panther, and whose blanket had
been used to cover their forms from the night
air?</p>

<p>“Brother!”</p>

<p>The word fell from the lips of the chief, and
rather staggered both lads, for they had not
dreamed that he knew a bit of English. But
his meaning was plainly indicated. After that
they were not to be looked upon in the light of
enemies, but honored friends. An Indian always
pays back a debt, whether of evil or
good.</p>

<p>Then the chief turned to Dick, and performed
the same service. The latter was
shrewd enough to know that, if anything was
to be done for Jasper Williams, now was the
accepted time. He had heard his father often
say “If you want to accomplish anything you
must strike while the iron is hot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>So he immediately threw one arm about the
shoulders of the scout, and, looking the great
chief squarely in the face, indicated Williams
as he spoke the words:</p>

<p>“Him brother too!”</p>

<p>Running Elk knew what was meant. He
hesitated, because there had been no mention
made of the scout taking part in the rescue of
those who belonged to his immediate family.
But from the warriors arose a chorus of
sounds, as though they had been swept off
their feet by the thrilling story of the squaw;
and were willing to do the thing handsomely.
So presently, in a less enthusiastic way, Running
Elk held out his hand to Jasper, who immediately
seized upon it, knowing as he did
that his life was to be spared.</p>

<p>After that it was easy to communicate, for
Williams could act as interpreter. He answered
all the questions of the chief, and even
tried to explain just why the expedition, led
by Captain Lewis, was in the country, telling
Running Elk that they had no designs on the
land of the Sioux, but were simply passing
through, and that it would likely be a great
many years before he would see another paleface
in all that section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt what the scout told Running Elk
would prove of great value, later, to the exploring
party, since it opened the eyes of the
Sioux chief to certain facts he had not known
before. It was likely to keep the Sioux from
going on the warpath against the little band of
daring whites—at least this particular branch
of them—and that would be worth something
in the long winter months, while the men
of the party had to do more or less hunting
in order to supply the camp with fresh
food.</p>

<p>There was one thing more Dick thought to
do. The Wolf was one of his company, and he
could not bear the thought of abandoning him
to his fate. So he urged upon Jasper to try to
have him included in the party when they went
forth from the village of the Sioux on the morrow.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, one poor Mandan brave
did not amount to much, in the estimation of
Running Elk, who thought he should do the
thing up completely while about it; for lo, and
behold, Wolf was brought forth at the time of
their departure, though the populace that
watched their going had only frowns for the
Indian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger’s last act, after again shaking the
hand of the chief, was to pass over to where
the old squaw was standing, a smile on her
broad brown face, and take her hand in his, as
though he would try to express his gratitude;
after which he bent down and kissed the little
Indian girl who had learned her first words of
English from him, while seated at their lonely
camp fire that night in the timber.</p>

<p>He would often remember Dove Eyes, and
her eagerness to learn to speak the language
of the palefaces.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the four went out of the
Sioux village unharmed, even honored with
loud yells that might be taken for the Indian
way of cheering. Jasper Williams declared
that it was the nearest approach to a miracle
he ever expected to see in all his days; and
that the kind deed which the two lads had done
on that other occasion had been returned to
them many fold.</p>

<p>And so the bread cast upon the waters had
come back to them after many days. No matter
how long they might live, Dick and Roger
would always believe that it paid to stand up
for the weak, and even risk their lives in defense
of the helpless. Only for that little happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
what might not have been their fate on
this morning that saw them started back
toward the Mandan town?</p>

<p>Of course they reached the camp in good
time, and great was the astonishment of the
explorers when they heard that the boys and
Williams had been prisoners in the village of
the great Sioux chief, Running Elk, who until
then had evinced the most bitter hostility
toward the whites, laboring under the belief,
which was fostered by the half-breed traders,
that they had come to steal away the lands of
the redmen.</p>

<p>Jasper Williams gladly signed the paper
Dick had with him, in the presence of both
Captain Lewis and Captain Clark, who were
only too pleased to add their honored names as
witnesses.</p>

<p>“I must say,” remarked the soldier leader
of the expedition, as he shook the hand of each
of the boys cordially, after this operation had
been duly carried out, and the precious paper
carefully placed away in a pocket of Dick’s
hunting tunic, “that I never did anything
with greater satisfaction in all my life, because
you boys have certainly shown yourselves
to be a credit to your brave grandfather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
in taking your lives in your hands, and
venturing all the way up into this unknown
wilderness, upon the noble mission of saving
the homes of your people.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added his associate, just as warmly,
as he too insisted upon squeezing the hands
of the cousins, “and if, after mature deliberation,
you decide to remain over with the expedition
until spring, and go with us to the wonderful
Western sea, across the mighty mountains
of which we have all heard so much,
depend on it you will find a warm welcome
here. For we have already come to regard
you with affection, and nothing would please
us more.”</p>

<p>Dick looked at Roger, and the latter smiled
happily, for to tell the truth the heart of the
more impulsive lad was very strongly set
upon remaining with these intrepid men.
Deep down in his soul was planted the love for
looking on new and wonderful sights; and for
years Roger had watched the glowing sun sink
to rest night after night with a secret hope
that some day he might be given the opportunity
to follow its track, and gaze upon sights
that the eyes of white men had never before
beheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>And now that chance lay at his door, if only
Dick would decide to stay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jasper Williams was explaining
just how it came that his signature was so
necessary on the paper which meant so much
to the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>It seemed that his mother had been connected
with a French family, and that, in
taking title to the property which he settled
on near the St. Louis trading post, David
Armstrong had neglected to properly secure
the signature of Jasper’s parents, as would
have been wise.</p>

<p>As they were both gone long since, the only
one who could attach his signature to the document
was Jasper himself; otherwise the property
could be taken possession of, after due
process of law, by any one who might have
brought it in. This the scheming Lascelles
must have learned, and the first thing old
David knew of the matter was a notification
that, unless he wished to be evicted in the
spring, he would have to purchase the several
farms over again, paying what was considered
an enormous price in those pioneer days.</p>

<p>Of course, now that the precious signature
of Jasper Williams, son of Helene Villefue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
was properly affixed to the paper, David Armstrong
could afford to snap his fingers at the
crafty French trader, and defy him. When
the scout made this affirmation it gave the two
boys the greatest satisfaction possible.</p>

<p>“We have nothing to regret in deciding to
make this trip, have we, Dick?” exclaimed the
impulsive Roger.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” replied his cousin;
“and if we had to do the whole thing over
again, even knowing how close to death we
should be brought, I am sure neither of us
would hesitate for a second. And to think that
now our homes will never be taken away from
our mothers. That was the cruel part of it;
and for one I can never forgive that French
trader, François Lascelles, for trying to do
such a rascally thing.”</p>

<p>“And as he is somewhere up in this country,
as we have reason to believe,” added
Roger, “looking for Jasper Williams with the
intention of trying to keep him from signing
his name to this paper, why, we may run
across him sooner or later—that is, of course,
if we decide to remain over with the expedition,
which I truly hope may be the case.”</p>

<p>“We will take a couple of days to talk it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
over,” was all Dick would say; but in his eyes
shone a light that gave Roger great hope.</p>

<p>And in the end that was the way it turned
out, much to the delight of the younger lad,
who would have been grievously disappointed
had it been decided best for himself and cousin
to return home that fall.</p>

<p>The two captains had interested themselves
greatly in the welfare of the boys, whom they
had come to admire very much. They fancied
that having these lads in camp, with their
cheery ways and sunny faces, would be a pleasure
for all concerned during the long winter
days and nights. And accordingly they used
what influence they could command to get Dick
to look at the thing reasonably.</p>

<p>The result was as might have been expected.
A picked party had been made up to start
down the river to St. Louis in a boat secured
from the Mandans, with a message for the
President, and the boys were influenced to
entrust their precious document to the charge
of one of the men, who was commanded by
Captain Lewis to surely deliver it, together
with letters from the boys, directly into the
hands of Grandfather Armstrong, before
starting for Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>For Dick and Roger had succumbed to the
great temptation to accept the generous offer
of the leader of the explorers, and remain over
the winter with them, going on in the spring
to the distant Pacific, and seeing those wonderful
Rocky Mountains of which they had
heard such amazing stories.</p>

<p>This they eventually did; and it may be well
understood that such a continuation of their
journey opened up a new field of adventures
for our heroes, some of which will be found
related in the pages of the next volume of this
series, to be called, “The Pioneer Boys of the
Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>And while they had seen no more of the half-breed,
Batiste Dupuy, or had the ill luck to run
across the French trader, François Lascelles,
while ascending the Missouri, it might be that
those same individuals would once more come
forward later on, to annoy Dick and Roger
under the false impression that they had not
yet secured the signature of Jasper Williams
to the document.</p>

<p>Free from the care that had so long been
oppressing them, the boys could now look forward
to a long period of enjoyment as the fall
drew on, and they became better acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
with their Mandan friends, and accompanied
the warriors on many of their hunts. And
while they are thus enjoying themselves to the
full, we will take our leave of them.</p>


<p class='center'>THE END.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_1"></a><a href="#Note_1r">Note 1</a> (<a href="#Page_3">page 3</a>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> of the vast country west of the Mississippi
River was owned in 1803 by France, Spain having
made a secret treaty with France by which she ceded
the territory of Louisiana, embracing the present
States of Montana, North and South Dakota, Nebraska,
Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Indian Territory, and part of Colorado.
President Jefferson, learning of this treaty, sent to
France a commission empowered to purchase the
island on which New Orleans stood; and also the right
of a passage to the sea. Napoleon Bonaparte responded
with an offer to sell all of Louisiana to the
United States for twenty million dollars. After bargaining
for awhile the vast territory was purchased
for fifteen million dollars. Bonaparte was delighted.
“This accession of territory,” said he, rubbing his
hands, “strengthens forever the power of the United
States. I have given England a rival upon the sea,
which will sooner or later humble her pride.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_2"></a><a href="#Note_2r">Note 2</a> (<a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Very few people realized the value of the newly
bought possessions, and many roundly abused President
Jefferson for making the purchase. But the
Western settlers were overjoyed. “At last,” they
said, “we have room for expansion. Hurrah for Jefferson!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Highly delighted at his success, the President
recommended to Congress, in a confidential message,
that a party should be dispatched to trace the
Missouri River to its source, cross the Rocky Mountains,
and go to the Pacific Coast. The plan was approved,
Captain Meriwether Lewis, the President’s
private secretary, being appointed to lead the expedition,
which was originally intended to consist of
nine young Kentuckians, fourteen United States
soldiers, two French voyageurs to serve as hunters and
interpreters, and a black servant for Captain William
Clark, who was a joint commander. On the 24th of
May, 1804, the little band of adventurous souls,
augmented by additional frontiersmen, left the mouth
of the Missouri, and struck out toward the unknown
West, with three boats, one a covered one, to carry
their possessions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_3"></a><a href="#Note_3r">Note 3</a> (<a href="#Page_131">page 131</a>)</span></h3>

<p>During its long course from the far away Rockies
to its junction with the mighty Mississippi, the Missouri
River penetrates every variety of country one
can think of. In many places it passes through vast
stretches of prairie land, where, as far as the eye can
reach, the country is like a billowy sea, being covered
with grass. Then again it cuts a channel between
rocks that form rapids quite as dangerous as those of
the Upper Nile, and known as the Cataracts. There
are banks that are heavily timbered; and even low
places, swampy, and almost impossible of navigation
for canoes. Much difficulty is encountered in avoiding
the islands that crop up, some covered only with rank
water grass, others bearing a luxuriant growth of
trees, such as sycamore, cottonwood, walnut, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
others. Sand-bars form and disappear daily, so that
a pilot never knows what he has before him in trying
to take a boat along this erratic stream. And it was
up this swift current that the daring explorers, led by
Lewis and Clark, ventured to push their three boats,
day after day, as the summer months glided on, facing
perils of every description, and bent on carrying out
the plans which the President himself had personally
approved, if indeed the entire scheme was not of his
own conception.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_4"></a><a href="#Note_4r">Note 4</a> (<a href="#Page_160">page 160</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Well might Roger say this, for at that day, and much
later also, it was no uncommon thing for a ranger on
the prairie to see, from some butte, a drove of bison
rolling by that seemed to stretch from horizon to horizon,
and take hours in passing. The Indians said they
were as many as the grains of sand on some of the
bars that could be found along the erratic course of
the great Missouri River. They hunted them in and
out of season, and killed tens of thousands, no doubt,
every year, often driving an entire herd over some
precipice for the sake of securing the tongues alone,
which were esteemed a great delicacy. But up to the
introduction of the repeating firearm, at about the
time the Central Pacific Railroad was being put
through, there seemed no perceptible diminution to
the vast number of the shaggy beasts. But civilization
came and finished the business; and at the present
time, save for a few scattered specimens, in small
droves, numbering some hundreds in all, the once
famous bison, called wrongly the buffalo, has been
entirely exterminated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_5"></a><a href="#Note_5r">Note 5</a> (<a href="#Page_274">page 274</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The Mandan tribe of Indians has always been more
or less of a mystery to those historians who have tried
to figure where the people inhabiting the country at
the time of the discovery of America, and its later
development, originally came from. They were of a
much lighter hue than any of the other Indians, and,
while some students have declared their positive belief
that they must have sprung from the lost tribe of
Israel, others claim to see certain similarities in customs
and even language between the Mandans and the
Welsh. These latter claim that at some time in the
remote past a vessel with a Welsh crew must have
been blown across the Atlantic ocean, and into the
Gulf of Mexico, by a severe storm; and that the survivors
made their way up the Mississippi, finally
marrying into a tribe of Indians; and that their descendants
still clung to some of the old-country ways.
It is very curious how many very plausible reasons
can be found for believing such a thing as this. It
may be true; but the point has never been wholly
proved; and so the origin of the “White Indians”
still remains shrouded in mystery to this day. The
Mandans suffered fearfully from the smallpox epidemic
after they began to have intimate relations with
the whites; and, in fact, the once great and powerful
tribe has been almost exterminated.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_6"></a><a href="#Note_6r">Note 6</a> (<a href="#Page_288">page 288</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Salt-licks, or saline springs, used to be very common
in the early days of the pioneers, and many of the
histories of those times make mention of them. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
in the African wilderness certain animals will come
many miles just to get a chance to lick up the salt at
a certain place. The same is true of numerous places
in our Wild West of to-day. Deer, in particular, are
fond of coming to a “lick.” The craving for a taste
of salt seems to induce them to cover vast distances.
Hunters, knowing this love for salt on the part of
game, often hide in ambush near such a magnet, and
shoot down wild animals with the greatest of ease.
Indeed, in some States the practice of lying in wait
at such a place is looked upon as unsportsmanlike, and
frowned down upon, even to the extent of making laws
for the protection of salt-hungry game.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_7"></a><a href="#Note_7r">Note 7</a> (<a href="#Page_290">page 290</a>)</span></h3>

<p>As the two boys, Dick and Roger, discovered for
themselves, when fortune allowed them to spend some
time in a Mandan village, these Indians had many
ways in common with other tribes, even while in certain
traits they differed greatly from the Blackfeet,
the Sioux, the Shoshones, and the Pawnees. One of
these consisted of the customary medicine-man, who
was supposed to be in direct communication with
Manitou, or the Great Spirit. When a storm came
along, and the thunder roared, this old humbug would
pretend to be talking with the Great Father above;
and, of course, would interpret as he pleased what the
Spirit was supposed to say in reply to his questions.
He always dressed in a hideous costume, and looked as
much like the Evil One as any person could imagine,
with his paint, his buffalo tails, his fanciful adornments,
and often the horns which he assumed for occasions.
His principal office as the “doctor,” or medicine-man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
is to frighten away the devils that are supposed to be
afflicting sick people. He would go through with a
tremendous amount of nonsense, and, if the sick person
got well, he had the credit of working a miracle;
whereas, if he or she died, it was the will of the Great
Spirit! Nor is the medicine-man confined to the Indian
tribes of North America; for the same species of
charlatan has been discovered in the heart of blackest
Africa, among the negro nations inhabiting that
region.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_8"></a><a href="#Note_8r">Note 8</a> (<a href="#Page_293">page 293</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The Mandans had many strange habits, some of
which must have come down to them from remote
ancestors; while others were doubtless the result of
their living in the country where wolves and coyotes
abounded, and had to be guarded against, even in the
disposal of the bodies of their dead. When a warrior
died his body was wrapped in several buffalo skins,
and the last one was tightly secured with thongs. Then
the funeral cortege took up its line of march for the
Indian cemetery, where, with fitting ceremonies, the
body was secured to a platform erected on four posts,
and usually some five or six feet from the ground.
Here the widow would repair day after day, communing
with the spirit of the departed one, and leaving a
bowl of hot succotash, a mixture of corn and beans.
This was intended as food to sustain the brave on his
long journey to the Land of Shades. The steam arising
and disappearing was believed to be inhaled by the
unseen spirit; and, of course, when the bowl was
found empty in the morning, having been cleaned out
by wandering animals, the Indians chose to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the dead warrior had in some way devoured its contents
during the still hours of the night.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_9"></a><a href="#Note_9r">Note 9</a> (<a href="#Page_324">page 324</a>)</span></h3>

<p>It was not for many years after the exploring expedition
of Lewis and Clark passed through the country
of the fierce and warlike Sioux tribe, that these Indians
learned how to handle firearms. At that day
they depended almost solely upon their bows and
arrows, spears, tomahawks and knives, to bring down
game, and fight their battles with other tribes with
whom they might chance to be at war. They gave
the early settlers great trouble, and many an uprising
was followed by massacres. As late as the seventies
they were a power to be reckoned with by the United
States Government; and the memory of the massacre
of General Custer’s gallant command will always be
one of the saddest records of border warfare. At that
time it is said that there were several thousand Sioux
warriors under Sitting Bull, which fact is sufficient to
explain why the Sioux have always been held in
such fear along the frontier of the Great Northwest.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_10"></a><a href="#Note_10r">Note 10</a> (<a href="#Page_332">page 332</a>)</span></h3>

<p>This ceremony of smoking the pipe at their councils
has always been a leading characteristic of Indian
nature. When a stranger visits a tribe, and is to be
treated as a friend, he is invited to smoke the peace
pipe; and this really consists in puffing smoke in the
direction of the north, east, south, and west. There
is some sort of meaning to it, of course, and it is understood
to stand for the promise on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
participants that they will remain friends for all time,
whether the wind blows from one quarter of the
compass or the other. It signifies complete concord
between them. Besides, this is a very sacred institution;
and like the breaking of bread among other
peoples, or the passing of salt with the Bedouins, or
Arabs of the desert, goes to signify that the bonds
between those assembled must not be severed lightly.
In the case of the council convened to settle the fate
of the white prisoners, possibly some other meaning
might have been attached to this puffing of the smoke
toward the four quarters.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>THE LITTLE COLONEL</div>
<div class='copy'>(Trade Mark)</div>


<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine
is a small girl, who is known as the Little Colonel,
on account of her fancied resemblance to an old-school
Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and old family
are famous in the region.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE GIANT SCISSORS</div>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel,
and in later volumes shares with her the delightful experiences
of the “House Party” and the “Holidays.”</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>TWO LITTLE KNIGHTS OF KENTUCKY</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel’s Neighbors</span>.</p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is not,
however, the central figure of the story, that place being
taken by the “two little knights.”</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>MILDRED’S INHERITANCE</div>

<p>A delightful little story of a lonely English girl who
comes to America and is befriended by a sympathetic
American family who are attracted by her beautiful
speaking voice. By means of this one gift she is enabled
to help a school-girl who has temporarily lost the
use of her eyes, and thus finally her life becomes a busy,
happy one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16ad" id="Page_16ad">[A-16]</a></span></p>


<div class='adtitle3'>CICELY AND OTHER STORIES FOR GIRLS</div>

<p>The readers of Mrs. Johnston’s charming juveniles
will be glad to learn of the issue of this volume for young
people.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>AUNT ’LIZA’S HERO AND OTHER STORIES</div>

<p>A collection of six bright little stories, which will appeal
to all boys and most girls.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>BIG BROTHER</div>

<p>A story of two boys. The devotion and care of Stephen,
himself a small boy, for his baby brother, is the theme of
the simple tale.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>OLE MAMMY’S TORMENT</div>

<p>“Ole Mammy’s Torment” has been fitly called “a
classic of Southern life.” It relates the haps and mishaps
of a small negro lad, and tells how he was led by
love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE STORY OF DAGO</div>

<p>In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago,
a pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago
tells his own story, and the account of his haps and mishaps
is both interesting and amusing.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE QUILT THAT JACK BUILT</div>

<p>A pleasant little story of a boy’s labor of love, and how
it changed the course of his life many years after it was
accomplished.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>FLIP’S ISLANDS OF PROVIDENCE</div>

<p>A story of a boy’s life battle, his early defeat, and the
final triumph, well worth the reading.</p>
